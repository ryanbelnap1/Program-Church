WebDriver
Getting Started
v4.0
Getting started
If you are new to Selenium, we have a few resources that can help you get up to speed right away.
Selenium supports automation of all the major browsers in the market through the use of WebDriver. WebDriver is an API and protocol that defines a language-neutral interface for controlling the behaviour of web browsers. Each browser is backed by a specific WebDriver implementation, called a driver. The driver is the component responsible for delegating down to the browser, and handles communication to and from Selenium and the browser.

This separation is part of a conscious effort to have browser vendors take responsibility for the implementation for their browsers. Selenium makes use of these third party drivers where possible, but also provides its own drivers maintained by the project for the cases when this is not a reality.

The Selenium framework ties all of these pieces together through a user-facing interface that enables the different browser backends to be used transparently, enabling cross-browser and cross-platform automation.

Selenium setup is quite different from the setup of other commercial tools. Before you can start writing Selenium code, you have to install the language bindings libraries for your language of choice, the browser you want to use, and the driver for that browser.

Follow the links below to get up and going with Selenium WebDriver.

Selenium components
Building a test suite using WebDriver will require you to understand and effectively use several components. As with everything in software, different people use different terms for the same idea. Below is a breakdown of how terms are used in this description.

Terminology
API: Application Programming Interface. This is the set of “commands” you use to manipulate WebDriver.
Library: A code module that contains the APIs and the code necessary to implement them. Libraries are specific to each language binding, eg .jar files for Java, .dll files for .NET, etc.
Driver: Responsible for controlling the actual browser. Most drivers are created by the browser vendors themselves. Drivers are generally executable modules that run on the system with the browser itself, not the system executing the test suite. (Although those may be the same system.) NOTE: Some people refer to the drivers as proxies.
Framework: An additional library that is used as a support for WebDriver suites. These frameworks may be test frameworks such as JUnit or NUnit. They may also be frameworks supporting natural language features such as Cucumber or Robotium. Frameworks may also be written and used for tasks such as manipulating or configuring the system under test, data creation, test oracles, etc.
The Parts and Pieces
At its minimum, WebDriver talks to a browser through a driver. Communication is two-way: WebDriver passes commands to the browser through the driver, and receives information back via the same route.

Basic Communication
The driver is specific to the browser, such as ChromeDriver for Google’s Chrome/Chromium, GeckoDriver for Mozilla’s Firefox, etc. The driver runs on the same system as the browser. This may or may not be the same system where the tests themselves are executed.

This simple example above is direct communication. Communication to the browser may also be remote communication through Selenium Server or RemoteWebDriver. RemoteWebDriver runs on the same system as the driver and the browser.

Remote Communication
Remote communication can also take place using Selenium Server or Selenium Grid, both of which in turn talk to the driver on the host system

Remote Communication with Grid
Where Frameworks fit in
WebDriver has one job and one job only: communicate with the browser via any of the methods above. WebDriver does not know a thing about testing: it does not know how to compare things, assert pass or fail, and it certainly does not know a thing about reporting or Given/When/Then grammar.

This is where various frameworks come into play. At a minimum, you will need a test framework that matches the language bindings, e.g., NUnit for .NET, JUnit for Java, RSpec for Ruby, etc.

The test framework is responsible for running and executing your WebDriver and related steps in your tests. As such, you can think of it looking akin to the following image.

Test Framework
Natural language frameworks/tools such as Cucumber may exist as part of that Test Framework box in the figure above, or they may wrap the Test Framework entirely in their custom implementation.

A deeper look at Selenium
Selenium is an umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries that enable and support the automation of web browsers.
Selenium controls web browsers
Selenium is many things but at its core, it is a toolset for web browser automation that uses the best techniques available to remotely control browser instances and emulate a user’s interaction with the browser.

Selenium allows users to simulate common activities performed by end-users; entering text into fields, selecting drop-down values and checking boxes, and clicking links in documents. It also provides many other controls such as mouse movement, arbitrary JavaScript execution, and much more.

Although used primarily for front-end testing of websites, Selenium is, at its core, a browser user agent library. The interfaces are ubiquitous to their application, encouraging composition with other libraries to suit your purpose.

One interface to rule them all
One of the project’s guiding principles is to support a common interface for all (major) browser technologies. Web browsers are incredibly complex, highly engineered applications, performing their operations in entirely different ways but which frequently look the same while doing so. Even though the text is rendered in the same fonts, the images are displayed in the same place, and the links take you to the same destination. What is happening underneath is as different as night and day. Selenium “abstracts” these differences, hiding their details and intricacies from the person writing the code. This allows you to write several lines of code to perform a complicated workflow, but these same lines will execute on Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, and all other supported browsers.

Tools and support
Selenium’s minimalist design approach gives it the versatility to be included as a component in bigger applications. The surrounding infrastructure provided under the Selenium umbrella gives you the tools to put together your grid of browsers so tests can be run on different browsers and multiple operating systems across a range of machines.

Imagine a bank of computers in your server room or data center all firing up browsers at the same time hitting your site’s links, forms, and tables—testing your application 24 hours a day. Through the simple programming interface provided for the most common languages, these tests will run tirelessly in parallel, reporting back to you when errors occur.

It is an aim to help make this a reality for you, by providing users with tools and documentation to not only control browsers but to make it easy to scale and deploy such grids.

Who uses Selenium
Many of the most important companies in the world have adopted Selenium for their browser-based testing, often replacing years-long efforts involving other proprietary tools. As it has grown in popularity, so have its requirements and challenges multiplied.

As the web becomes more complicated and new technologies are added to websites, it’s the mission of this project to keep up with them where possible. Being an open-source project, this support is provided through the generous donation of time from many volunteers, every one of which has a “day job.”

Another mission of the project is to encourage more volunteers to partake in this effort, and build a strong community so that the project can continue to keep up with emerging technologies and remain a dominant platform for functional test automation.

WebDriver
Browsers
Chrome
v4.0
Chrome specific functionality
These are capabilities and features specific to Google Chrome browsers.
By default, Selenium 4 is compatible with Chrome v75 and greater. Note that the version of the Chrome browser and the version of chromedriver must match the major version.

Options
Capabilities common to all browsers are described on the Options page.

Capabilities unique to Chrome and Chromium are documented at Google’s page for Capabilities & ChromeOptions

Starting a Chrome session with basic defined options looks like this:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = get_default_chrome_options()
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
 View full example on GitHub
Arguments
The args parameter is for a list of command line switches to be used when starting the browser. There are two excellent resources for investigating these arguments:

Chrome Flags for Tooling
List of Chromium Command Line Switches
Commonly used args include --start-maximized, --headless=new and --user-data-dir=...

Add an argument to options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_argument("--start-maximized")
 View full example on GitHub
Start browser in a specified location
The binary parameter takes the path of an alternate location of browser to use. With this parameter you can use chromedriver to drive various Chromium based browsers.

Add a browser location to options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.binary_location = chrome_bin
 View full example on GitHub
Add extensions
The extensions parameter accepts crx files. As for unpacked directories, please use the load-extension argument instead, as mentioned in this post.

Add an extension to options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_extension(extension_file_path)
 View full example on GitHub
Keeping browser open
Setting the detach parameter to true will keep the browser open after the process has ended, so long as the quit command is not sent to the driver.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_experimental_option("detach", True)
 View full example on GitHub
Excluding arguments
Chromedriver has several default arguments it uses to start the browser. If you do not want those arguments added, pass them into excludeSwitches. A common example is to turn the popup blocker back on. A full list of default arguments can be parsed from the Chromium Source Code

Set excluded arguments on options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_experimental_option('excludeSwitches', ['disable-popup-blocking'])
 View full example on GitHub
Service
Examples for creating a default Service object, and for setting driver location and port can be found on the Driver Service page.

Log output
Getting driver logs can be helpful for debugging issues. The Service class lets you direct where the logs will go. Logging output is ignored unless the user directs it somewhere.

File output
To change the logging output to save to a specific file:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Selenium v4.11

    service = webdriver.ChromeService(log_output=log_path)
 View full example on GitHub
Console output
To change the logging output to display in the console as STDOUT:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Selenium v4.11

    service = webdriver.ChromeService(log_output=subprocess.STDOUT)
 View full example on GitHub
Log level
There are 6 available log levels: ALL, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, SEVERE, and OFF. Note that --verbose is equivalent to --log-level=ALL and --silent is equivalent to --log-level=OFF, so this example is just setting the log level generically:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Selenium v4.11

    service = webdriver.ChromeService(service_args=['--log-level=DEBUG'], log_output=subprocess.STDOUT)
 View full example on GitHub
Log file features
There are 2 features that are only available when logging to a file:

append log
readable timestamps
To use them, you need to also explicitly specify the log path and log level. The log output will be managed by the driver, not the process, so minor differences may be seen.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    service = webdriver.ChromeService(service_args=['--append-log', '--readable-timestamp'], log_output=log_path)
 View full example on GitHub
Disabling build check
Chromedriver and Chrome browser versions should match, and if they don’t the driver will error. If you disable the build check, you can force the driver to be used with any version of Chrome. Note that this is an unsupported feature, and bugs will not be investigated.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Selenium v4.11

    service = webdriver.ChromeService(service_args=['--disable-build-check'], log_output=subprocess.STDOUT)
 View full example on GitHub
Special Features
Some browsers have implemented additional features that are unique to them.

Casting
You can drive Chrome Cast devices, including sharing tabs

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
        sinks = driver.get_sinks()
        if sinks:
            sink_name = sinks[0]['name']
            driver.start_tab_mirroring(sink_name)
            driver.stop_casting(sink_name)
 View full example on GitHub
Network conditions
You can simulate various network conditions.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    network_conditions = {
        "offline": False,
        "latency": 20,  # 20 ms of latency
        "download_throughput": 2000 * 1024 / 8,  # 2000 kbps
        "upload_throughput": 2000 * 1024 / 8,    # 2000 kbps
    }
    driver.set_network_conditions(**network_conditions)

Edge specific functionality
These are capabilities and features specific to Microsoft Edge browsers.
Microsoft Edge is implemented with Chromium, with the earliest supported version of v79. Similar to Chrome, the major version number of edgedriver must match the major version of the Edge browser.

Options
Capabilities common to all browsers are described on the Options page.

Capabilities unique to Chromium are documented at Google’s page for Capabilities & ChromeOptions

Starting an Edge session with basic defined options looks like this:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = get_default_edge_options()
    driver = webdriver.Edge(options=options)
 View full example on GitHub
Arguments
The args parameter is for a list of command line switches to be used when starting the browser. There are two excellent resources for investigating these arguments:

Chrome Flags for Tooling
List of Chromium Command Line Switches
Commonly used args include --start-maximized, --headless=new and --user-data-dir=...

Add an argument to options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_argument("--start-maximized")
 View full example on GitHub
Start browser in a specified location
The binary parameter takes the path of an alternate location of browser to use. With this parameter you can use chromedriver to drive various Chromium based browsers.

Add a browser location to options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.binary_location = edge_bin
 View full example on GitHub
Add extensions
The extensions parameter accepts crx files. As for unpacked directories, please use the load-extension argument instead, as mentioned in this post.

Add an extension to options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_extension(extension_file_path)
 View full example on GitHub
Keeping browser open
Setting the detach parameter to true will keep the browser open after the process has ended, so long as the quit command is not sent to the driver.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_experimental_option("detach", True)
 View full example on GitHub
Excluding arguments
MSEdgedriver has several default arguments it uses to start the browser. If you do not want those arguments added, pass them into excludeSwitches. A common example is to turn the popup blocker back on. A full list of default arguments can be parsed from the Chromium Source Code

Set excluded arguments on options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_experimental_option('excludeSwitches', ['disable-popup-blocking'])
 View full example on GitHub
Service
Examples for creating a default Service object, and for setting driver location and port can be found on the Driver Service page.

Log output
Getting driver logs can be helpful for debugging issues. The Service class lets you direct where the logs will go. Logging output is ignored unless the user directs it somewhere.

File output
To change the logging output to save to a specific file:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    service = webdriver.EdgeService(log_output=log_path)
 View full example on GitHub
Console output
To change the logging output to display in the console as STDOUT:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Selenium v4.11

    service = webdriver.EdgeService(log_output=subprocess.STDOUT)
 View full example on GitHub
Log level
There are 6 available log levels: ALL, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, SEVERE, and OFF. Note that --verbose is equivalent to --log-level=ALL and --silent is equivalent to --log-level=OFF, so this example is just setting the log level generically:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    service = webdriver.EdgeService(service_args=['--log-level=DEBUG'], log_output=log_path)
 View full example on GitHub
Log file features
There are 2 features that are only available when logging to a file:

append log
readable timestamps
To use them, you need to also explicitly specify the log path and log level. The log output will be managed by the driver, not the process, so minor differences may be seen.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    service = webdriver.EdgeService(service_args=['--append-log', '--readable-timestamp'], log_output=log_path)
 View full example on GitHub
Disabling build check
Edge browser and msedgedriver versions should match, and if they don’t the driver will error. If you disable the build check, you can force the driver to be used with any version of Edge. Note that this is an unsupported feature, and bugs will not be investigated.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    service = webdriver.EdgeService(service_args=['--disable-build-check'], log_output=log_path)
 View full example on GitHub
Internet Explorer Mode
Microsoft Edge can be driven in “Internet Explorer Compatibility Mode”, which uses the Internet Explorer Driver classes in conjunction with Microsoft Edge. Read the Internet Explorer page for more details.

Special Features
Some browsers have implemented additional features that are unique to them.

Casting
You can drive Chrome Cast devices with Edge, including sharing tabs

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
        sinks = driver.get_sinks()
        if sinks:
            sink_name = sinks[0]['name']
            driver.start_tab_mirroring(sink_name)
            driver.stop_casting(sink_name)
 View full example on GitHub
Network conditions
You can simulate various network conditions.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    network_conditions = {
        "offline": False,
        "latency": 20,  # 20 ms of latency
        "download_throughput": 2000 * 1024 / 8,  # 2000 kbps
        "upload_throughput": 2000 * 1024 / 8,    # 2000 kbps
    }
    driver.set_network_conditions(**network_conditions)

Add-ons
Unlike Chrome, Firefox extensions are not added as part of capabilities as mentioned in this issue, they are created after starting the driver.

The following examples are for local webdrivers. For remote webdrivers, please refer to the Remote WebDriver page.

Installation
A signed xpi file you would get from Mozilla Addon page

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.install_addon(addon_path_xpi)

Uninstallation
Uninstalling an addon requires knowing its id. The id can be obtained from the return value when installing the add-on.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.uninstall_addon(id)
 View full example on GitHub
Unsigned installation
When working with an unfinished or unpublished extension, it will likely not be signed. As such, it can only be installed as “temporary.” This can be done by passing in either a zip file or a directory, here’s an example with a directory:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.install_addon(addon_path_dir, temporary=True)

IE specific functionality
These are capabilities and features specific to Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers.
As of June 2022, Selenium officially no longer supports standalone Internet Explorer. The Internet Explorer driver still supports running Microsoft Edge in “IE Compatibility Mode.”

Special considerations
The IE Driver is the only driver maintained by the Selenium Project directly. While binaries for both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer are available, there are some known limitations with the 64-bit driver. As such it is recommended to use the 32-bit driver.

Additional information about using Internet Explorer can be found on the IE Driver Server page

Options
Starting a Microsoft Edge browser in Internet Explorer Compatibility mode with basic defined options looks like this:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    options.attach_to_edge_chrome = True
    options.edge_executable_path = edge_bin
    driver = webdriver.Ie(options=options)
 View full example on GitHub
As of Internet Explorer Driver v4.5.0:

If IE is not present on the system (default in Windows 11), you do not need to use the two parameters above. IE Driver will use Edge and will automatically locate it.
If IE and Edge are both present on the system, you only need to set attaching to Edge, IE Driver will automatically locate Edge on your system.
So, if IE is not on the system, you only need:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    driver = webdriver.Ie(options=options)
 View full example on GitHub
Here are a few common use cases with different capabilities:

fileUploadDialogTimeout
In some environments, Internet Explorer may timeout when opening the File Upload dialog. IEDriver has a default timeout of 1000ms, but you can increase the timeout using the fileUploadDialogTimeout capability.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    options.file_upload_timeout = 2000
 View full example on GitHub
ensureCleanSession
When set to true, this capability clears the Cache, Browser History and Cookies for all running instances of InternetExplorer including those started manually or by the driver. By default, it is set to false.

Using this capability will cause performance drop while launching the browser, as the driver will wait until the cache gets cleared before launching the IE browser.

This capability accepts a Boolean value as parameter.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    options.ensure_clean_session = True

ignoreZoomSetting
InternetExplorer driver expects the browser zoom level to be 100%, else the driver will throw an exception. This default behaviour can be disabled by setting the ignoreZoomSetting to true.

This capability accepts a Boolean value as parameter.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    options.ignore_zoom_level = True
 View full example on GitHub
ignoreProtectedModeSettings
Whether to skip the Protected Mode check while launching a new IE session.

If not set and Protected Mode settings are not same for all zones, an exception will be thrown by the driver.

If capability is set to true, tests may become flaky, unresponsive, or browsers may hang. However, this is still by far a second-best choice, and the first choice should always be to actually set the Protected Mode settings of each zone manually. If a user is using this property, only a “best effort” at support will be given.

This capability accepts a Boolean value as parameter.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    options.ignore_protected_mode_settings = True

silent
When set to true, this capability suppresses the diagnostic output of the IEDriverServer.

This capability accepts a Boolean value as parameter.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    service = webdriver.IeService(service_args=["--silent"])
    driver = webdriver.Ie(service=service)
 View full example on GitHub
Command-Line Options
Internet Explorer includes several command-line options that enable you to troubleshoot and configure the browser.

The following describes few supported command-line options

-private : Used to start IE in private browsing mode. This works for IE 8 and later versions.

-k : Starts Internet Explorer in kiosk mode. The browser opens in a maximized window that does not display the address bar, the navigation buttons, or the status bar.

-extoff : Starts IE in no add-on mode. This option specifically used to troubleshoot problems with browser add-ons. Works in IE 7 and later versions.

Note: forceCreateProcessApi should to enabled in-order for command line arguments to work.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    options.add_argument("-private")

    driver = webdriver.Ie(options=options)
 View full example on GitHub
forceCreateProcessApi
Forces launching Internet Explorer using the CreateProcess API. The default value is false.

For IE 8 and above, this option requires the “TabProcGrowth” registry value to be set to 0.

Waiting Strategies
Perhaps the most common challenge for browser automation is ensuring that the web application is in a state to execute a particular Selenium command as desired. The processes often end up in a race condition where sometimes the browser gets into the right state first (things work as intended) and sometimes the Selenium code executes first (things do not work as intended). This is one of the primary causes of flaky tests.

All navigation commands wait for a specific readyState value based on the page load strategy (the default value to wait for is "complete") before the driver returns control to the code. The readyState only concerns itself with loading assets defined in the HTML, but loaded JavaScript assets often result in changes to the site, and elements that need to be interacted with may not yet be on the page when the code is ready to execute the next Selenium command.

Similarly, in a lot of single page applications, elements get dynamically added to a page or change visibility based on a click. An element must be both present and displayed on the page in order for Selenium to interact with it.

Take this page for example: https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/web/dynamic.html When the “Add a box!” button is clicked, a “div” element that does not exist is created. When the “Reveal a new input” button is clicked, a hidden text field element is displayed. In both cases the transition takes a couple seconds. If the Selenium code is to click one of these buttons and interact with the resulting element, it will do so before that element is ready and fail.

The first solution many people turn to is adding a sleep statement to pause the code execution for a set period of time. Because the code can’t know exactly how long it needs to wait, this can fail when it doesn’t sleep long enough. Alternately, if the value is set too high and a sleep statement is added in every place it is needed, the duration of the session can become prohibitive.

Selenium provides two different mechanisms for synchronization that are better.

Implicit waits
Selenium has a built-in way to automatically wait for elements called an implicit wait. An implicit wait value can be set either with the timeouts capability in the browser options, or with a driver method (as shown below).

This is a global setting that applies to every element location call for the entire session. The default value is 0, which means that if the element is not found, it will immediately return an error. If an implicit wait is set, the driver will wait for the duration of the provided value before returning the error. Note that as soon as the element is located, the driver will return the element reference and the code will continue executing, so a larger implicit wait value won’t necessarily increase the duration of the session.

Warning: Do not mix implicit and explicit waits. Doing so can cause unpredictable wait times. For example, setting an implicit wait of 10 seconds and an explicit wait of 15 seconds could cause a timeout to occur after 20 seconds.

Solving our example with an implicit wait looks like this:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.implicitly_wait(2)
 View full example on GitHub
Explicit waits
Explicit waits are loops added to the code that poll the application for a specific condition to evaluate as true before it exits the loop and continues to the next command in the code. If the condition is not met before a designated timeout value, the code will give a timeout error. Since there are many ways for the application not to be in the desired state, explicit waits are a great choice to specify the exact condition to wait for in each place it is needed. Another nice feature is that, by default, the Selenium Wait class automatically waits for the designated element to exist.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
This example shows the condition being waited for as a lambda. Python also supports Expected Conditions

    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=2)
    wait.until(lambda _ : revealed.is_displayed())
 View full example on GitHub
Customization
The Wait class can be instantiated with various parameters that will change how the conditions are evaluated.

This can include:

Changing how often the code is evaluated (polling interval)
Specifying which exceptions should be handled automatically
Changing the total timeout length
Customizing the timeout message
For instance, if the element not interactable error is retried by default, then we can add an action on a method inside the code getting executed (we just need to make sure that the code returns true when it is successful):

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    errors = [NoSuchElementException, ElementNotInteractableException]
    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=2, poll_frequency=.2, ignored_exceptions=errors)
    wait.until(lambda _ : revealed.send_keys("Displayed") or True)

File Upload
Because Selenium cannot interact with the file upload dialog, it provides a way to upload files without opening the dialog. If the element is an input element with type file, you can use the send keys method to send the full path to the file that will be uploaded.

Locators

Locator strategies
Ways to identify one or more specific elements in the DOM.
A locator is a way to identify elements on a page. It is the argument passed to the Finding element methods.

Check out our encouraged test practices for tips on locators, including which to use when and why to declare locators separately from the finding methods.

Traditional Locators
Selenium provides support for these 8 traditional location strategies in WebDriver:

Locator	Description
class name	Locates elements whose class name contains the search value (compound class names are not permitted)
css selector	Locates elements matching a CSS selector
id	Locates elements whose ID attribute matches the search value
name	Locates elements whose NAME attribute matches the search value
link text	Locates anchor elements whose visible text matches the search value
partial link text	Locates anchor elements whose visible text contains the search value. If multiple elements are matching, only the first one will be selected.
tag name	Locates elements whose tag name matches the search value
xpath	Locates elements matching an XPath expression
Creating Locators
To work on a web element using Selenium, we need to first locate it on the web page. Selenium provides us above mentioned ways, using which we can locate element on the page. To understand and create locator we will use the following HTML snippet.

<html>
<body>
<style>
.information {
  background-color: white;
  color: black;
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>
<h2>Contact Selenium</h2>

<form>
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="m" />Male &nbsp;
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="f" />Female <br>
  <br>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input class="information" type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="Jane"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input class="information" type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <label for="newsletter">Newsletter:</label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="newsletter" value="1" /><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

css selector
CSS is the language used to style HTML pages. We can use css selector locator strategy to identify the element on the page. If the element has an id, we create the locator as css = #id. Otherwise the format we follow is css =[attribute=value] . Let us see an example from above HTML snippet. We will create locator for First Name textbox, using css.

xpath
A HTML document can be considered as a XML document, and then we can use xpath which will be the path traversed to reach the element of interest to locate the element. The XPath could be absolute xpath, which is created from the root of the document. Example - /html/form/input[1]. This will return the male radio button. Or the xpath could be relative. Example- //input[@name=‘fname’]. This will return the first name text box. Let us create locator for female radio button using xpath.

Utilizing Locators
The FindElement makes using locators a breeze! For most languages, all you need to do is utilize webdriver.common.by.By, however in others it’s as simple as setting a parameter in the FindElement function

Relative Locators
Selenium 4 introduces Relative Locators (previously called Friendly Locators). These locators are helpful when it is not easy to construct a locator for the desired element, but easy to describe spatially where the element is in relation to an element that does have an easily constructed locator.

How it works
Selenium uses the JavaScript function getBoundingClientRect() to determine the size and position of elements on the page, and can use this information to locate neighboring elements.

Relative locator methods can take as the argument for the point of origin, either a previously located element reference, or another locator. In these examples we’ll be using locators only, but you could swap the locator in the final method with an element object and it will work the same.

Let us consider the below example for understanding the relative locators.

Relative Locators
Available relative locators
Above
If the email text field element is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the password text field element is, we can locate the text field element using the fact that it is an “input” element “above” the password element.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
email_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, "input").above({By.ID: "password"})
Below
If the password text field element is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the email text field element is, we can locate the text field element using the fact that it is an “input” element “below” the email element.

Move Code

Kotlin
password_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, "input").below({By.ID: "email"})
Left of
If the cancel button is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the submit button element is, we can locate the cancel button element using the fact that it is a “button” element to the “left of” the submit element.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
cancel_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, "button").to_left_of({By.ID: "submit"})
Right of
If the submit button is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the cancel button element is, we can locate the submit button element using the fact that it is a “button” element “to the right of” the cancel element.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
submit_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, "button").to_right_of({By.ID: "cancel"})
Near
If the relative positioning is not obvious, or it varies based on window size, you can use the near method to identify an element that is at most 50px away from the provided locator. One great use case for this is to work with a form element that doesn’t have an easily constructed locator, but its associated input label element does.

You can also chain locators if needed. Sometimes the element is most easily identified as being both above/below one element and right/left of another.

Finding web elements
Locating the elements based on the provided locator values.
One of the most fundamental aspects of using Selenium is obtaining element references to work with. Selenium offers a number of built-in locator strategies to uniquely identify an element. There are many ways to use the locators in very advanced scenarios. For the purposes of this documentation, let’s consider this HTML snippet:

<ol id="vegetables">
 <li class="potatoes">…
 <li class="onions">…
 <li class="tomatoes"><span>Tomato is a Vegetable</span>…
</ol>
<ul id="fruits">
  <li class="bananas">…
  <li class="apples">…
  <li class="tomatoes"><span>Tomato is a Fruit</span>…
</ul>
First matching element
Many locators will match multiple elements on the page. The singular find element method will return a reference to the first element found within a given context.

Evaluating entire DOM
When the find element method is called on the driver instance, it returns a reference to the first element in the DOM that matches with the provided locator. This value can be stored and used for future element actions. In our example HTML above, there are two elements that have a class name of “tomatoes” so this method will return the element in the “vegetables” list.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
vegetable = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "tomatoes")
  
Evaluating a subset of the DOM
Rather than finding a unique locator in the entire DOM, it is often useful to narrow the search to the scope of another located element. In the above example there are two elements with a class name of “tomatoes” and it is a little more challenging to get the reference for the second one.

One solution is to locate an element with a unique attribute that is an ancestor of the desired element and not an ancestor of the undesired element, then call find element on that object:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
fruits = driver.find_element(By.ID, "fruits")
fruit = fruits.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME,"tomatoes")
  
Java and C#
WebDriver, WebElement and ShadowRoot classes all implement a SearchContext interface, which is considered a role-based interface. Role-based interfaces allow you to determine whether a particular driver implementation supports a given feature. These interfaces are clearly defined and try to adhere to having only a single role of responsibility.

Evaluating the Shadow DOM
The Shadow DOM is an encapsulated DOM tree hidden inside an element. With the release of v96 in Chromium Browsers, Selenium can now allow you to access this tree with easy-to-use shadow root methods. NOTE: These methods require Selenium 4.0 or greater.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
shadow_host = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, '#shadow_host')
shadow_root = shadow_host.shadow_root
shadow_content = shadow_root.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, '#shadow_content')
Optimized locator
A nested lookup might not be the most effective location strategy since it requires two separate commands to be issued to the browser.

To improve the performance slightly, we can use either CSS or XPath to find this element in a single command. See the Locator strategy suggestions in our Encouraged test practices section.

For this example, we’ll use a CSS Selector:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
fruit = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR,"#fruits .tomatoes")
  
All matching elements
There are several use cases for needing to get references to all elements that match a locator, rather than just the first one. The plural find elements methods return a collection of element references. If there are no matches, an empty list is returned. In this case, references to all fruits and vegetable list items will be returned in a collection.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
plants = driver.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "li")
  
Get element
Often you get a collection of elements but want to work with a specific element, which means you need to iterate over the collection and identify the one you want.

Python

elements = driver.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, 'p')

for e in elements:
    print(e.text)
  
Find Elements From Element
It is used to find the list of matching child WebElements within the context of parent element. To achieve this, the parent WebElement is chained with ‘findElements’ to access child elements

    # Get all the elements available with tag name 'p'
elements = element.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, 'p')
for e in elements:
    print(e.text)

##get elements from parent element using XPATH
##NOTE: in order to utilize XPATH from current element, you must add "." to beginning of path

    # Get first element of tag 'ul'
element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//ul')

    # get children of tag 'ul' with tag 'li'
elements  = driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, './/li')

WebDriver
Elements
Interactions
v4.0
Interacting with web elements
A high-level instruction set for manipulating form controls.
There are only 5 basic commands that can be executed on an element:

click (applies to any element)
send keys (only applies to text fields and content editable elements)
clear (only applies to text fields and content editable elements)
submit (only applies to form elements)
select (see Select List Elements)
Additional validations
These methods are designed to closely emulate a user’s experience, so, unlike the Actions API, it attempts to perform two things before attempting the specified action.

If it determines the element is outside the viewport, it scrolls the element into view, specifically it will align the bottom of the element with the bottom of the viewport.
It ensures the element is interactable before taking the action. This could mean that the scrolling was unsuccessful, or that the element is not otherwise displayed. Determining if an element is displayed on a page was too difficult to define directly in the webdriver specification, so Selenium sends an execute command with a JavaScript atom that checks for things that would keep the element from being displayed. If it determines an element is not in the viewport, not displayed, not keyboard-interactable, or not pointer-interactable, it returns an element not interactable error.
Click
The element click command is executed on the center of the element. If the center of the element is obscured for some reason, Selenium will return an element click intercepted error.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    # Navigate to URL

    # Click on the checkbox
    check_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "checkbox_input")
    check_input.click()
 View full example on GitHub
Send keys
The element send keys command types the provided keys into an editable element. Typically, this means an element is an input element of a form with a text type or an element with a content-editable attribute. If it is not editable, an invalid element state error is returned.

Here is the list of possible keystrokes that WebDriver Supports.

Java
Python

Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    # Handle the email input field
    email_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "email_input")
    email_input.clear()  # Clear field
    
    email = "admin@localhost.dev"
    email_input.send_keys(email)  # Enter text
 View full example on GitHub
Clear
The element clear command resets the content of an element. This requires an element to be editable, and resettable. Typically, this means an element is an input element of a form with a text type or an element with acontent-editable attribute. If these conditions are not met, an invalid element state error is returned.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin

Submit
In Selenium 4 this is no longer implemented with a separate endpoint and functions by executing a script. As such, it is recommended not to use this method and to click the applicable form submission button instead.

Information about web elements
What you can learn about an element.
There are a number of details you can query about a specific element.

Is Displayed
This method is used to check if the connected Element is displayed on a webpage. Returns a Boolean value, True if the connected element is displayed in the current browsing context else returns false.

This functionality is mentioned in, but not defined by the w3c specification due to the impossibility of covering all potential conditions. As such, Selenium cannot expect drivers to implement this functionality directly, and now relies on executing a large JavaScript function directly. This function makes many approximations about an element’s nature and relationship in the tree to return a value.

Alerts
v4.0
JavaScript alerts, prompts and confirmations
WebDriver provides an API for working with the three types of native popup messages offered by JavaScript. These popups are styled by the browser and offer limited customisation.

Alerts
The simplest of these is referred to as an alert, which shows a custom message, and a single button which dismisses the alert, labelled in most browsers as OK. It can also be dismissed in most browsers by pressing the close button, but this will always do the same thing as the OK button. See an example alert.

WebDriver can get the text from the popup and accept or dismiss these alerts.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    element = driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "See an example alert")
    element.click()

    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=2)
    alert = wait.until(lambda d : d.switch_to.alert)
    text = alert.text
    alert.accept()
 View full example on GitHub
Confirm
A confirm box is similar to an alert, except the user can also choose to cancel the message. See a sample confirm.

This example also shows a different approach to storing an alert:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    element = driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "See a sample confirm")
    driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", element)

    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=2)
    alert = wait.until(lambda d : d.switch_to.alert)
    text = alert.text
    alert.dismiss()
 View full example on GitHub
Prompt
Prompts are similar to confirm boxes, except they also include a text input. Similar to working with form elements, you can use WebDriver’s send keys to fill in a response. This will completely replace the placeholder text. Pressing the cancel button will not submit any text. See a sample prompt.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    element = driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "See a sample prompt")
    driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", element)

    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=2)
    alert = wait.until(lambda d : d.switch_to.alert)
    alert.send_keys("Selenium")
    text = alert.text
    alert.accept()

Cookies
v4.0
Working with cookies
A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent from a website and stored in your computer. Cookies are mostly used to recognise the user and load the stored information.

WebDriver API provides a way to interact with cookies with built-in methods:

Add Cookie
It is used to add a cookie to the current browsing context. Add Cookie only accepts a set of defined serializable JSON object. Here is the link to the list of accepted JSON key values

First of all, you need to be on the domain that the cookie will be valid for. If you are trying to preset cookies before you start interacting with a site and your homepage is large / takes a while to load an alternative is to find a smaller page on the site (typically the 404 page is small, e.g. http://example.com/some404page)

    # Delete all cookies
    driver.delete_all_cookies()
 View full example on GitHub
Same-Site Cookie Attribute
It allows a user to instruct browsers to control whether cookies are sent along with the request initiated by third party sites. It is introduced to prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.

Same-Site cookie attribute accepts two parameters as instructions

Strict:
When the sameSite attribute is set as Strict, the cookie will not be sent along with requests initiated by third party websites.

Lax:
When you set a cookie sameSite attribute to Lax, the cookie will be sent along with the GET request initiated by third party website.

Note: As of now this feature is landed in chrome(80+version), Firefox(79+version) and works with Selenium 4 and later versions.

Frames
v4.0
Working with IFrames and frames
Frames are a now deprecated means of building a site layout from multiple documents on the same domain. You are unlikely to work with them unless you are working with an pre HTML5 webapp. Iframes allow the insertion of a document from an entirely different domain, and are still commonly used.

If you need to work with frames or iframes, WebDriver allows you to work with them in the same way. Consider a button within an iframe. If we inspect the element using the browser development tools, we might see the following:

<div id="modal">
  <iframe id="buttonframe" name="myframe"  src="https://seleniumhq.github.io">
   <button>Click here</button>
 </iframe>
</div>
If it was not for the iframe we would expect to click on the button using something like:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    # This Wont work
driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, 'button').click()
  
However, if there are no buttons outside of the iframe, you might instead get a no such element error. This happens because Selenium is only aware of the elements in the top level document. To interact with the button, we will need to first switch to the frame, in a similar way to how we switch windows. WebDriver offers three ways of switching to a frame. Following example code shows how we can do that, using a live web example.

Using a WebElement
Switching using a WebElement is the most flexible option. You can find the frame using your preferred selector and switch to it.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    # Store iframe web element
iframe = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "#modal > iframe")

    # switch to selected iframe
driver.switch_to.frame(iframe)

    # Now click on button
driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, 'button').click()
  
Using a name or ID
If your frame or iframe has an id or name attribute, this can be used instead. If the name or ID is not unique on the page, then the first one found will be switched to.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    # Switch frame by id
driver.switch_to.frame('buttonframe')

    # Now, Click on the button
driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, 'button').click()
  
Using an index
It is also possible to use the index of the frame, such as can be queried using window.frames in JavaScript.

Move Code

Java
Ruby
CSharp
JavaScript
Kotlin
         //switch To IFrame using index
         driver.switchTo().frame(0);
 View full example on GitHub
Leaving a frame
To leave an iframe or frameset, switch back to the default content like so:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    # switch back to default content
driver.switch_to.default_content()

Print Page
v4.0
Print Page
Printing a webpage is a common task, whether for sharing information or maintaining archives. Selenium simplifies this process through its PrintOptions, PrintsPage, and browsingContext classes, which provide a flexible and intuitive interface for automating the printing of web pages. These classes enable you to configure printing preferences, such as page layout, margins, and scaling, ensuring that the output meets your specific requirements.

Configuring
Orientation
Using the getOrientation() and setOrientation() methods, you can get/set the page orientation — either PORTRAIT or LANDSCAPE.

Java
CSharp
Ruby
Python
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.get("https://www.selenium.dev/")
    print_options = PrintOptions()
    print_options.orientation = "landscape" ## landscape or portrait
 View full example on GitHub
Range
Using the getPageRanges() and setPageRanges() methods, you can get/set the range of pages to print — e.g. “2-4”.

Java
CSharp
Ruby
Python
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.get("https://www.selenium.dev/")
    print_options = PrintOptions()
    print_options.page_ranges = ["1, 2, 3"] ## ["1", "2", "3"] or ["1-3"]
 View full example on GitHub
Size
Using the getPageSize() and setPageSize() methods, you can get/set the paper size to print — e.g. “A0”, “A6”, “Legal”, “Tabloid”, etc.

Java
CSharp
Ruby
Python
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.get("https://www.selenium.dev/")
    print_options = PrintOptions()
    print_options.page_height = 27.94  # Use page_width to assign width
 View full example on GitHub
Margins
Using the getPageMargin() and setPageMargin() methods, you can set the margin sizes of the page you wish to print — i.e. top, bottom, left, and right margins.

Java
CSharp
Ruby
Python
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.get("https://www.selenium.dev/")
    print_options = PrintOptions()
    print_options.margin_top = 10
    print_options.margin_bottom = 10
    print_options.margin_left = 10
    print_options.margin_right = 10
 View full example on GitHub
Scale
Using getScale() and setScale() methods, you can get/set the scale of the page you wish to print — e.g. 1.0 is 100% or default, 0.25 is 25%, etc.

Java
CSharp
Ruby
Python
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.get("https://www.selenium.dev/")
    print_options = PrintOptions()
    print_options.scale = 0.5 ## 0.1 to 2.0
    current_scale = print_options.scale
 View full example on GitHub
Background
Using getBackground() and setBackground() methods, you can get/set whether background colors and images appear — boolean true or false.

Java
CSharp
Ruby
Python
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.get("https://www.selenium.dev/")
    print_options = PrintOptions()
    print_options.background = True ## True or False
 View full example on GitHub
ShrinkToFit
Using getShrinkToFit() and setShrinkToFit() methods, you can get/set whether the page will shrink-to-fit content on the page — boolean true or false.

Java
CSharp
Ruby
Python
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.get("https://www.selenium.dev/")
    print_options = PrintOptions()
    print_options.shrink_to_fit = True ## True or False
 View full example on GitHub
Printing
Once you’ve configured your PrintOptions, you’re ready to print the page. To do this, you can invoke the print function, which generates a PDF representation of the web page. The resulting PDF can be saved to your local storage for further use or distribution. Using PrintsPage(), the print command will return the PDF data in base64-encoded format, which can be decoded and written to a file in your desired location, and using BrowsingContext() will return a String.

There may currently be multiple implementations depending on your language of choice. For example, with Java you have the ability to print using either BrowingContext() or PrintsPage(). Both take PrintOptions() objects as a parameter.

Note: BrowsingContext() is part of Selenium’s BiDi implementation. To enable BiDi see Enabling Bidi

Windows
v4.0
Working with windows and tabs
Windows and tabs
Get window handle
WebDriver does not make the distinction between windows and tabs. If your site opens a new tab or window, Selenium will let you work with it using a window handle. Each window has a unique identifier which remains persistent in a single session. You can get the window handle of the current window by using:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
driver.current_window_handle
Switching windows or tabs
Clicking a link which opens in a new window will focus the new window or tab on screen, but WebDriver will not know which window the Operating System considers active. To work with the new window you will need to switch to it. For this, we fetch all window handles, and store them in an array. The array position fills in the order the window is launched. So first position will be default browser, and so on.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

with webdriver.Firefox() as driver:
    # Open URL
    driver.get("https://seleniumhq.github.io")

    # Setup wait for later
    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)

    # Store the ID of the original window
    original_window = driver.current_window_handle

    # Check we don't have other windows open already
    assert len(driver.window_handles) == 1

    # Click the link which opens in a new window
    driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "new window").click()

    # Wait for the new window or tab
    wait.until(EC.number_of_windows_to_be(2))

    # Loop through until we find a new window handle
    for window_handle in driver.window_handles:
        if window_handle != original_window:
            driver.switch_to.window(window_handle)
            break

    # Wait for the new tab to finish loading content
    wait.until(EC.title_is("SeleniumHQ Browser Automation"))
  
Closing a window or tab
When you are finished with a window or tab and it is not the last window or tab open in your browser, you should close it and switch back to the window you were using previously. Assuming you followed the code sample in the previous section you will have the previous window handle stored in a variable. Put this together and you will get:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    #Close the tab or window
driver.close()

    #Switch back to the old tab or window
driver.switch_to.window(original_window)
  
Forgetting to switch back to another window handle after closing a window will leave WebDriver executing on the now closed page, and will trigger a No Such Window Exception. You must switch back to a valid window handle in order to continue execution.

Create new window (or) new tab and switch
Creates a new window (or) tab and will focus the new window or tab on screen. You don’t need to switch to work with the new window (or) tab. If you have more than two windows (or) tabs opened other than the new window, you can loop over both windows or tabs that WebDriver can see, and switch to the one which is not the original.

Note: This feature works with Selenium 4 and later versions.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    # Opens a new tab and switches to new tab
driver.switch_to.new_window('tab')

    # Opens a new window and switches to new window
driver.switch_to.new_window('window')
  
Quitting the browser at the end of a session
When you are finished with the browser session you should call quit, instead of close:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
driver.quit()
Quit will:
Close all the windows and tabs associated with that WebDriver session
Close the browser process
Close the background driver process
Notify Selenium Grid that the browser is no longer in use so it can be used by another session (if you are using Selenium Grid)
Failure to call quit will leave extra background processes and ports running on your machine which could cause you problems later.

Some test frameworks offer methods and annotations which you can hook into to tear down at the end of a test.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    # unittest teardown
    # https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html?highlight=teardown#unittest.TestCase.tearDown
def tearDown(self):
    self.driver.quit()
  
If not running WebDriver in a test context, you may consider using try / finally which is offered by most languages so that an exception will still clean up the WebDriver session.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
try:
    #WebDriver code here...
finally:
    driver.quit()
  
Python’s WebDriver now supports the python context manager, which when using the with keyword can automatically quit the driver at the end of execution.

with webdriver.Firefox() as driver:
  # WebDriver code here...

# WebDriver will automatically quit after indentation
Window management
Screen resolution can impact how your web application renders, so WebDriver provides mechanisms for moving and resizing the browser window.

Virtual Authenticator
v4.0
Virtual Authenticator
A representation of the Web Authenticator model.
Web applications can enable a public key-based authentication mechanism known as Web Authentication to authenticate users in a passwordless manner. Web Authentication defines APIs that allows a user to create a public-key credential and register it with an authenticator. An authenticator can be a hardware device or a software entity that stores user’s public-key credentials and retrieves them on request.

As the name suggests, Virtual Authenticator emulates such authenticators for testing.

WebDriver
Actions API
v4.0
Actions API
A low-level interface for providing virtualized device input actions to the web browser.
In addition to the high-level element interactions, the Actions API provides granular control over exactly what designated input devices can do. Selenium provides an interface for 3 kinds of input sources: a key input for keyboard devices, a pointer input for a mouse, pen or touch devices, and wheel inputs for scroll wheel devices (introduced in Selenium 4.2). Selenium allows you to construct individual action commands assigned to specific inputs and chain them together and call the associated perform method to execute them all at once.

Action Builder
In the move from the legacy JSON Wire Protocol to the new W3C WebDriver Protocol, the low level building blocks of actions became especially detailed. It is extremely powerful, but each input device has a number of ways to use it and if you need to manage more than one device, you are responsible for ensuring proper synchronization between them.

Thankfully, you likely do not need to learn how to use the low level commands directly, since almost everything you might want to do has been given a convenience method that combines the lower level commands for you. These are all documented in keyboard, mouse, pen, and wheel pages.

Pause
Pointer movements and Wheel scrolling allow the user to set a duration for the action, but sometimes you just need to wait a beat between actions for things to work correctly.

Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    clickable = driver.find_element(By.ID, "clickable")

        .pause(1)\
        .send_keys("abc")\
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Release All Actions
An important thing to note is that the driver remembers the state of all the input items throughout a session. Even if you create a new instance of an actions class, the depressed keys and the location of the pointer will be in whatever state a previously performed action left them.

There is a special method to release all currently depressed keys and pointer buttons. This method is implemented differently in each of the languages because it does not get executed with the perform method.

Keyboard
v4.0
Keyboard actions
A representation of any key input device for interacting with a web page.
There are only 2 actions that can be accomplished with a keyboard: pressing down on a key, and releasing a pressed key. In addition to supporting ASCII characters, each keyboard key has a representation that can be pressed or released in designated sequences.

Keys
In addition to the keys represented by regular unicode, unicode values have been assigned to other keyboard keys for use with Selenium. Each language has its own way to reference these keys; the full list can be found here.

Mouse
v4.0
Mouse actions
A representation of any pointer device for interacting with a web page.
There are only 3 actions that can be accomplished with a mouse: pressing down on a button, releasing a pressed button, and moving the mouse. Selenium provides convenience methods that combine these actions in the most common ways.

Click and hold
This method combines moving the mouse to the center of an element with pressing the left mouse button. This is useful for focusing a specific element:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    clickable = driver.find_element(By.ID, "clickable")
    ActionChains(driver) \
        .click_and_hold(clickable) \
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Click and release
This method combines moving to the center of an element with pressing and releasing the left mouse button. This is otherwise known as “clicking”:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    clickable = driver.find_element(By.ID, "click")
    ActionChains(driver) \
        .click(clickable) \
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Alternate Button Clicks
There are a total of 5 defined buttons for a Mouse:

0 — Left Button (the default)
1 — Middle Button (currently unsupported)
2 — Right Button
3 — X1 (Back) Button
4 — X2 (Forward) Button
Context Click
This method combines moving to the center of an element with pressing and releasing the right mouse button (button 2). This is otherwise known as “right-clicking”:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    clickable = driver.find_element(By.ID, "clickable")
    ActionChains(driver) \
        .context_click(clickable) \
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Back Click
There is no convenience method for this, it is just pressing and releasing mouse button 3

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Selenium v4.2

    action = ActionBuilder(driver)
    action.pointer_action.pointer_down(MouseButton.BACK)

Double click
This method combines moving to the center of an element with pressing and releasing the left mouse button twice.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    clickable = driver.find_element(By.ID, "clickable")
    ActionChains(driver) \
        .double_click(clickable) \
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Move to element
This method moves the mouse to the in-view center point of the element. This is otherwise known as “hovering.” Note that the element must be in the viewport or else the command will error.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    hoverable = driver.find_element(By.ID, "hover")
    ActionChains(driver) \
        .move_to_element(hoverable) \
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Move by offset
These methods first move the mouse to the designated origin and then by the number of pixels in the provided offset. Note that the position of the mouse must be in the viewport or else the command will error.

Offset from Element
This method moves the mouse to the in-view center point of the element, then moves by the provided offset.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    mouse_tracker = driver.find_element(By.ID, "mouse-tracker")
    ActionChains(driver) \
        .move_to_element_with_offset(mouse_tracker, 8, 0) \
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Offset from Viewport
This method moves the mouse from the upper left corner of the current viewport by the provided offset.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    action = ActionBuilder(driver)
    action.pointer_action.move_to_location(8, 0)
    action.perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Offset from Current Pointer Location
This method moves the mouse from its current position by the offset provided by the user. If the mouse has not previously been moved, the position will be in the upper left corner of the viewport. Note that the pointer position does not change when the page is scrolled.

Note that the first argument X specifies to move right when positive, while the second argument Y specifies to move down when positive. So moveByOffset(30, -10) moves right 30 and up 10 from the current mouse position.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    ActionChains(driver) \
        .move_by_offset(13, 15) \
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Drag and Drop on Element
This method firstly performs a click-and-hold on the source element, moves to the location of the target element and then releases the mouse.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    draggable = driver.find_element(By.ID, "draggable")
    droppable = driver.find_element(By.ID, "droppable")

Wheel
v4.0
Scroll wheel actions
A representation of a scroll wheel input device for interacting with a web page.
Selenium v4.2

Chromium Only

There are 5 scenarios for scrolling on a page.

Scroll to element
This is the most common scenario. Unlike traditional click and send keys methods, the actions class does not automatically scroll the target element into view, so this method will need to be used if elements are not already inside the viewport.

This method takes a web element as the sole argument.

Regardless of whether the element is above or below the current viewscreen, the viewport will be scrolled so the bottom of the element is at the bottom of the screen.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    iframe = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "iframe")
    ActionChains(driver)\
        .scroll_to_element(iframe)\
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Scroll by given amount
This is the second most common scenario for scrolling. Pass in an delta x and a delta y value for how much to scroll in the right and down directions. Negative values represent left and up, respectively.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    footer = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "footer")
    delta_y = footer.rect['y']
    ActionChains(driver)\
        .scroll_by_amount(0, delta_y)\
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Scroll from an element by a given amount
This scenario is effectively a combination of the above two methods.

To execute this use the “Scroll From” method, which takes 3 arguments. The first represents the origination point, which we designate as the element, and the second two are the delta x and delta y values.

If the element is out of the viewport, it will be scrolled to the bottom of the screen, then the page will be scrolled by the provided delta x and delta y values.

    ActionChains(driver)\
        .scroll_from_origin(scroll_origin, 0, 200)\
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Scroll from an element with an offset
This scenario is used when you need to scroll only a portion of the screen, and it is outside the viewport. Or is inside the viewport and the portion of the screen that must be scrolled is a known offset away from a specific element.

This uses the “Scroll From” method again, and in addition to specifying the element, an offset is specified to indicate the origin point of the scroll. The offset is calculated from the center of the provided element.

If the element is out of the viewport, it first will be scrolled to the bottom of the screen, then the origin of the scroll will be determined by adding the offset to the coordinates of the center of the element, and finally the page will be scrolled by the provided delta x and delta y values.

Note that if the offset from the center of the element falls outside of the viewport, it will result in an exception.

Java

Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    footer = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "footer")

        .scroll_from_origin(scroll_origin, 0, 200)\
        .perform()
 View full example on GitHub
Scroll from a offset of origin (element) by given amount
The final scenario is used when you need to scroll only a portion of the screen, and it is already inside the viewport.

This uses the “Scroll From” method again, but the viewport is designated instead of an element. An offset is specified from the upper left corner of the current viewport. After the origin point is determined, the page will be scrolled by the provided delta x and delta y values.

Note that if the offset from the upper left corner of the viewport falls outside of the screen, it will result in an exception.

In most cases this is what you want; it ensures that the browser is doing the expected things in the right order, but there are a number of interesting things that can be done with asynchronous interactions.

This functionality is currently available in a limited fashion with the [Chrome DevTools Protocol] (CDP), but to address some of its drawbacks, the Selenium team, along with the major browser vendors, have worked to create the new WebDriver BiDi Protocol. This specification aims to create a stable, cross-browser API that leverages bidirectional communication for enhanced browser automation and testing functionality, including streaming events from the user agent to the controlling software via WebSockets. Users will be able to listen for and record or manipulate events as they happen during the course of a Selenium session.

Enabling BiDi in Selenium
In order to use WebDriver BiDi, setting the capability in the browser options will enable the required functionality:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
options.enable_bidi = True
This enables the WebSocket connection for bidirectional communication, unlocking the full potential of the WebDriver BiDi protocol.

Note that Selenium is updating its entire implementation from WebDriver Classic to WebDriver BiDi (while maintaining backwards compatibility as much as possible), but this section of documentation focuses on the new functionality that bidirectional communication allows. The low-level BiDi domains will be accessible in the code to the end user, but the goal is to provide high-level APIs that are straightforward methods of real-world use cases. As such, the low-level components will not be documented, and this section will focus only on the user-friendly features that we encourage users to take advantage of.

WebDriver
BiDi
CDP
v4.0
Chrome DevTools Protocol
Examples of working with Chrome DevTools Protocol in Selenium. CDP support is temporary until WebDriver BiDi has been implemented.
Many browsers provide “DevTools” – a set of tools that are integrated with the browser that developers can use to debug web apps and explore the performance of their pages. Google Chrome’s DevTools make use of a protocol called the Chrome DevTools Protocol (or “CDP” for short). As the name suggests, this is not designed for testing, nor to have a stable API, so functionality is highly dependent on the version of the browser.

Selenium is working to implement a standards-based, cross-browser, stable alternative to CDP called [WebDriver BiDi]. Until the support for this new protocol has finished, Selenium plans to provide access to CDP features where applicable.

Using Chrome DevTools Protocol with Selenium
Chrome and Edge have a method to send basic CDP commands. This does not work for features that require bidirectional communication, and you need to know what domains to enable when and the exact names and types of domains/methods/parameters.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    cookie = {'name': 'cheese',
              'value': 'gouda',
              'domain': 'www.selenium.dev',
              'secure': True}

    driver.execute_cdp_cmd('Network.setCookie', cookie)
 View full example on GitHub
To make working with CDP easier, and to provide access to the more advanced features, Selenium bindings automatically generate classes and methods for the most common domains. CDP methods and implementations can change from version to version, though, so you want to keep the version of Chrome and the version of DevTools matching. Selenium supports the 3 most recent versions of Chrome at any given time, and tries to time releases to ensure that access to the latest versions are available.

This limitation provides additional challenges for several bindings, where dynamically generated CDP support requires users to regularly update their code to reference the proper version of CDP. In some cases an idealized implementation has been created that should work for any version of CDP without the user needing to change their code, but that is not always available.

Examples of how to use CDP in your Selenium tests can be found on the following pages, but we want to call out a couple commonly cited examples that are of limited practical value.

Geo Location — almost all sites use the IP address to determine physical location, so setting an emulated geolocation rarely has the desired effect.
Overriding Device Metrics — Chrome provides a great API for setting Mobile Emulation in the Options classes, which is generally superior to attempting to do this with CDP.

Waiting with Expected Conditions
These are classes used to describe what needs to be waited for.
Expected Conditions are used with Explicit Waits. Instead of defining the block of code to be executed with a lambda, an expected conditions method can be created to represent common things that get waited on. Some methods take locators as arguments, others take elements as arguments.

These methods can include conditions such as:

element is stale
element is visible
text is visible

Colors
v4.0
Working With Colors
You will occasionally want to validate the colour of something as part of your tests; the problem is that colour definitions on the web are not constant. Would it not be nice if there was an easy way to compare a HEX representation of a colour with a RGB representation of a colour, or a RGBA representation of a colour with a HSLA representation of a colour?

Worry not. There is a solution: the Color class!

First of all, you will need to import the class:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
from selenium.webdriver.support.color import Color
  
You can now start creating colour objects. Every colour object will need to be created from a string representation of your colour. Supported colour representations are:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
HEX_COLOUR = Color.from_string('#2F7ED8')
RGB_COLOUR = Color.from_string('rgb(255, 255, 255)')
RGB_COLOUR = Color.from_string('rgb(40%, 20%, 40%)')
RGBA_COLOUR = Color.from_string('rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)')
RGBA_COLOUR = Color.from_string('rgba(40%, 20%, 40%, 0.5)')
HSL_COLOUR = Color.from_string('hsl(100, 0%, 50%)')
HSLA_COLOUR = Color.from_string('hsla(100, 0%, 50%, 0.5)')
  
The Color class also supports all of the base colour definitions specified in http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#html4.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
BLACK = Color.from_string('black')
CHOCOLATE = Color.from_string('chocolate')
HOTPINK = Color.from_string('hotpink')
  
Sometimes browsers will return a colour value of “transparent” if no colour has been set on an element. The Color class also supports this:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
TRANSPARENT = Color.from_string('transparent')
  
You can now safely query an element to get its colour/background colour knowing that any response will be correctly parsed and converted into a valid Color object:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
login_button_colour = Color.from_string(driver.find_element(By.ID,'login').value_of_css_property('color'))

login_button_background_colour = Color.from_string(driver.find_element(By.ID,'login').value_of_css_property('background-color'))
  
You can then directly compare colour objects:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
assert login_button_background_colour == HOTPINK
  
Or you can convert the colour into one of the following formats and perform a static validation:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
assert login_button_background_colour.hex == '#ff69b4'
assert login_button_background_colour.rgba == 'rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)'
assert login_button_background_colour.rgb == 'rgb(255, 105, 180)'
  
Colours are no longer a problem.

The Selenium Color class makes it easy to compare colors across different formats (HEX, RGB, RGBA, HSL, etc.), which is useful for UI testing. 🎨✅

🔹 Example in Python:
python
Copy
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.color import Color

# Start WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://www.example.com")

# Get button color
button = driver.find_element(By.ID, "login")
button_color = Color.from_string(button.value_of_css_property("background-color"))

# Compare colors
expected_color = Color.from_string("hotpink")
assert button_color == expected_color, f"Expected {expected_color}, got {button_color}"

# Convert to different formats
print("HEX:", button_color.hex)       # Example: #ff69b4
print("RGB:", button_color.rgb)       # Example: rgb(255, 105, 180)
print("RGBA:", button_color.rgba)     # Example: rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)

driver.quit()

Select Lists
v4.0
Working with select list elements
Select lists have special behaviors compared to other elements.
The Select object will now give you a series of commands that allow you to interact with a <select> element.

If you are using Java or .NET make sure that you’ve properly required the support package in your code. See the full code from GitHub in any of the examples below.

Note that this class only works for HTML elements select and option. It is possible to design drop-downs with JavaScript overlays using div or li, and this class will not work for those.

Types
Select methods may behave differently depending on which type of <select> element is being worked with.

Single select
This is the standard drop-down object where one and only one option may be selected.

<select name="selectomatic">
    <option selected="selected" id="non_multi_option" value="one">One</option>
    <option value="two">Two</option>
    <option value="four">Four</option>
    <option value="still learning how to count, apparently">Still learning how to count, apparently</option>
</select>
Multiple select
This select list allows selecting and deselecting more than one option at a time. This only applies to <select> elements with the multiple attribute.

<select name="multi" id="multi" multiple="multiple">
    <option selected="selected" value="eggs">Eggs</option>
    <option value="ham">Ham</option>
    <option selected="selected" value="sausages">Sausages</option>
    <option value="onion gravy">Onion gravy</option>
</select>
Create class
First locate a <select> element, then use it to initialize a Select object. Note that as of Selenium 4.5, you can’t create a Select object if the <select> element is disabled.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    select_element = driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'selectomatic')
    select = Select(select_element)
 View full example on GitHub
List options
There are two lists that can be obtained:

All options
Get a list of all options in the <select> element:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    option_list = select.options
 View full example on GitHub
Selected options
Get a list of selected options in the <select> element. For a standard select list this will only be a list with one element, for a multiple select list it can contain zero or many elements.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    selected_option_list = select.all_selected_options
 View full example on GitHub
Select option
The Select class provides three ways to select an option. Note that for multiple select type Select lists, you can repeat these methods for each element you want to select.

Text
Select the option based on its visible text

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    select.select_by_visible_text('Four')
 View full example on GitHub
Value
Select the option based on its value attribute

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    select.select_by_value('two')

Index
Select the option based on its position in the list

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    select.select_by_index(3)
 View full example on GitHub
Disabled options
Selenium v4.5

Options with a disabled attribute may not be selected.

    <select name="single_disabled">
      <option id="sinlge_disabled_1" value="enabled">Enabled</option>
      <option id="sinlge_disabled_2" value="disabled" disabled="disabled">Disabled</option>
    </select>
Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    with pytest.raises(NotImplementedError):
        select.select_by_value('disabled')

De-select option
Only multiple select type select lists can have options de-selected. You can repeat these methods for each element you want to select.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby

📝 Selenium Select Class for Dropdowns
The Select class in Selenium provides a set of methods to handle <select> dropdowns efficiently.
It only works with HTML <select> elements, not JavaScript-based dropdowns.

🔹 Example in Python
python
Copy
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select

# Start WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://www.example.com")

# Locate the select dropdown
select_element = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "selectomatic")

# Initialize the Select object
dropdown = Select(select_element)

# Select by visible text
dropdown.select_by_visible_text("Four")

# Select by value attribute
dropdown.select_by_value("two")

# Select by index (0-based)
dropdown.select_by_index(3)

# Get all options
all_options = [opt.text for opt in dropdown.options]
print("All options:", all_options)

# Get selected option(s)
selected_option = dropdown.first_selected_option.text
print("Selected:", selected_option)

# For multiple select dropdowns: Deselect an option
# dropdown.deselect_by_value("eggs")

driver.quit()
✅ Methods Available in Select Class
Method	Usage
select_by_visible_text("Four")	Selects option with visible text "Four"
select_by_value("two")	Selects option with value="two"
select_by_index(3)	Selects the 4th option (index starts at 0)
options	Returns all options as a list
all_selected_options	Returns all selected options (for multiple selects)
first_selected_option	Returns the first selected option
deselect_by_value("eggs")	Deselects "eggs" (only for <select multiple>)
🎯 Key Notes
For multiple selection dropdowns, you can use deselect_by_* methods.
Disabled options (<option disabled>) cannot be selected.

ThreadGuard
v4.0
ThreadGuard
This class is only available in the Java Binding

ThreadGuard checks that a driver is called only from the same thread that created it. Threading issues especially when running tests in Parallel may have mysterious and hard to diagnose errors. Using this wrapper prevents this category of errors and will raise an exception when it happens.

The following example simulate a clash of threads:

public class DriverClash {
  //thread main (id 1) created this driver
  private WebDriver protectedDriver = ThreadGuard.protect(new ChromeDriver()); 

  static {
    System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "<Set path to your Chromedriver>");
  }
  
  //Thread-1 (id 24) is calling the same driver causing the clash to happen
  Runnable r1 = () -> {protectedDriver.get("https://selenium.dev");};
  Thread thr1 = new Thread(r1);
   
  void runThreads(){
    thr1.start();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new DriverClash().runThreads();
  }
}
The result shown below:

Exception in thread "Thread-1" org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException:
Thread safety error; this instance of WebDriver was constructed
on thread main (id 1)and is being accessed by thread Thread-1 (id 24)
This is not permitted and *will* cause undefined behaviour
As seen in the example:

protectedDriver Will be created in Main thread
We use Java Runnable to spin up a new process and a new Thread to run the process
Both Thread will clash because the Main Thread does not have protectedDriver in it’s memory.
ThreadGuard.protect will throw an exception.
Note:
This does not replace the need for using ThreadLocal to manage drivers when running parallel.

Troubleshooting Assistance
How to solve WebDriver problems.
It is not always obvious the root cause of errors in Selenium.

The most common Selenium-related error is a result of poor synchronization. Read about Waiting Strategies. If you aren’t sure if it is a synchronization strategy you can try temporarily hard coding a large sleep where you see the issue, and you’ll know if adding an explicit wait can help.

Note that many errors that get reported to the project are actually caused by issues in the underlying drivers that Selenium sends the commands to. You can rule out a driver problem by executing the command in multiple browsers.

WebDriver
Waits
v4.0
Waiting Strategies
Perhaps the most common challenge for browser automation is ensuring that the web application is in a state to execute a particular Selenium command as desired. The processes often end up in a race condition where sometimes the browser gets into the right state first (things work as intended) and sometimes the Selenium code executes first (things do not work as intended). This is one of the primary causes of flaky tests.

All navigation commands wait for a specific readyState value based on the page load strategy (the default value to wait for is "complete") before the driver returns control to the code. The readyState only concerns itself with loading assets defined in the HTML, but loaded JavaScript assets often result in changes to the site, and elements that need to be interacted with may not yet be on the page when the code is ready to execute the next Selenium command.

Similarly, in a lot of single page applications, elements get dynamically added to a page or change visibility based on a click. An element must be both present and displayed on the page in order for Selenium to interact with it.

Take this page for example: https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/web/dynamic.html When the “Add a box!” button is clicked, a “div” element that does not exist is created. When the “Reveal a new input” button is clicked, a hidden text field element is displayed. In both cases the transition takes a couple seconds. If the Selenium code is to click one of these buttons and interact with the resulting element, it will do so before that element is ready and fail.

The first solution many people turn to is adding a sleep statement to pause the code execution for a set period of time. Because the code can’t know exactly how long it needs to wait, this can fail when it doesn’t sleep long enough. Alternately, if the value is set too high and a sleep statement is added in every place it is needed, the duration of the session can become prohibitive.

Selenium provides two different mechanisms for synchronization that are better.

Implicit waits
Selenium has a built-in way to automatically wait for elements called an implicit wait. An implicit wait value can be set either with the timeouts capability in the browser options, or with a driver method (as shown below).

This is a global setting that applies to every element location call for the entire session. The default value is 0, which means that if the element is not found, it will immediately return an error. If an implicit wait is set, the driver will wait for the duration of the provided value before returning the error. Note that as soon as the element is located, the driver will return the element reference and the code will continue executing, so a larger implicit wait value won’t necessarily increase the duration of the session.

Warning: Do not mix implicit and explicit waits. Doing so can cause unpredictable wait times. For example, setting an implicit wait of 10 seconds and an explicit wait of 15 seconds could cause a timeout to occur after 20 seconds.

Solving our example with an implicit wait looks like this:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.implicitly_wait(2)
 View full example on GitHub
Explicit waits
Explicit waits are loops added to the code that poll the application for a specific condition to evaluate as true before it exits the loop and continues to the next command in the code. If the condition is not met before a designated timeout value, the code will give a timeout error. Since there are many ways for the application not to be in the desired state, explicit waits are a great choice to specify the exact condition to wait for in each place it is needed. Another nice feature is that, by default, the Selenium Wait class automatically waits for the designated element to exist.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
This example shows the condition being waited for as a lambda. Python also supports Expected Conditions

    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=2)
    wait.until(lambda _ : revealed.is_displayed())
 View full example on GitHub
Customization
The Wait class can be instantiated with various parameters that will change how the conditions are evaluated.

This can include:

Changing how often the code is evaluated (polling interval)
Specifying which exceptions should be handled automatically
Changing the total timeout length
Customizing the timeout message
For instance, if the element not interactable error is retried by default, then we can add an action on a method inside the code getting executed (we just need to make sure that the code returns true when it is successful):

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    errors = [NoSuchElementException, ElementNotInteractableException]
    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=2, poll_frequency=.2, ignored_exceptions=errors)
    wait.until(lambda _ : revealed.send_keys("Displayed") or True)

Browsers
Chrome
v4.0
Chrome specific functionality
These are capabilities and features specific to Google Chrome browsers.
By default, Selenium 4 is compatible with Chrome v75 and greater. Note that the version of the Chrome browser and the version of chromedriver must match the major version.

Options
Capabilities common to all browsers are described on the Options page.

Capabilities unique to Chrome and Chromium are documented at Google’s page for Capabilities & ChromeOptions

Starting a Chrome session with basic defined options looks like this:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = get_default_chrome_options()
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
 View full example on GitHub
Arguments
The args parameter is for a list of command line switches to be used when starting the browser. There are two excellent resources for investigating these arguments:

Chrome Flags for Tooling
List of Chromium Command Line Switches
Commonly used args include --start-maximized, --headless=new and --user-data-dir=...

Add an argument to options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_argument("--start-maximized")
 View full example on GitHub
Start browser in a specified location
The binary parameter takes the path of an alternate location of browser to use. With this parameter you can use chromedriver to drive various Chromium based browsers.

Add a browser location to options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.binary_location = chrome_bin
 View full example on GitHub
Add extensions
The extensions parameter accepts crx files. As for unpacked directories, please use the load-extension argument instead, as mentioned in this post.

Add an extension to options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_extension(extension_file_path)
 View full example on GitHub
Keeping browser open
Setting the detach parameter to true will keep the browser open after the process has ended, so long as the quit command is not sent to the driver.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_experimental_option("detach", True)
 View full example on GitHub
Excluding arguments
Chromedriver has several default arguments it uses to start the browser. If you do not want those arguments added, pass them into excludeSwitches. A common example is to turn the popup blocker back on. A full list of default arguments can be parsed from the Chromium Source Code

Set excluded arguments on options:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options.add_experimental_option('excludeSwitches', ['disable-popup-blocking'])
 View full example on GitHub
Service
Examples for creating a default Service object, and for setting driver location and port can be found on the Driver Service page.

Log output
Getting driver logs can be helpful for debugging issues. The Service class lets you direct where the logs will go. Logging output is ignored unless the user directs it somewhere.

File output
To change the logging output to save to a specific file:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Selenium v4.11

    service = webdriver.ChromeService(log_output=log_path)
 View full example on GitHub
Console output
To change the logging output to display in the console as STDOUT:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Selenium v4.11

    service = webdriver.ChromeService(log_output=subprocess.STDOUT)
 View full example on GitHub
Log level
There are 6 available log levels: ALL, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, SEVERE, and OFF. Note that --verbose is equivalent to --log-level=ALL and --silent is equivalent to --log-level=OFF, so this example is just setting the log level generically:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Selenium v4.11

    service = webdriver.ChromeService(service_args=['--log-level=DEBUG'], log_output=subprocess.STDOUT)
 View full example on GitHub
Log file features
There are 2 features that are only available when logging to a file:

append log
readable timestamps
To use them, you need to also explicitly specify the log path and log level. The log output will be managed by the driver, not the process, so minor differences may be seen.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    service = webdriver.ChromeService(service_args=['--append-log', '--readable-timestamp'], log_output=log_path)
 View full example on GitHub
Disabling build check
Chromedriver and Chrome browser versions should match, and if they don’t the driver will error. If you disable the build check, you can force the driver to be used with any version of Chrome. Note that this is an unsupported feature, and bugs will not be investigated.

Java
Python

Add-ons
Unlike Chrome, Firefox extensions are not added as part of capabilities as mentioned in this issue, they are created after starting the driver.

The following examples are for local webdrivers. For remote webdrivers, please refer to the Remote WebDriver page.

Installation
A signed xpi file you would get from Mozilla Addon page

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.install_addon(addon_path_xpi)

Uninstallation
Uninstalling an addon requires knowing its id. The id can be obtained from the return value when installing the add-on.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    driver.uninstall_addon(id)
 View full example on GitHub
Unsigned installation
When working with an unfinished or unpublished extension, it will likely not be signed. As such, it can only be installed as “temporary.” This can be done by passing in either a zip file or a directory, here’s an example with a directory:

Java
Python

WebDriver
Browsers
Internet Explorer
v4.0
IE specific functionality
These are capabilities and features specific to Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers.
As of June 2022, Selenium officially no longer supports standalone Internet Explorer. The Internet Explorer driver still supports running Microsoft Edge in “IE Compatibility Mode.”

Special considerations
The IE Driver is the only driver maintained by the Selenium Project directly. While binaries for both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer are available, there are some known limitations with the 64-bit driver. As such it is recommended to use the 32-bit driver.

Additional information about using Internet Explorer can be found on the IE Driver Server page

Options
Starting a Microsoft Edge browser in Internet Explorer Compatibility mode with basic defined options looks like this:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    options.attach_to_edge_chrome = True
    options.edge_executable_path = edge_bin
    driver = webdriver.Ie(options=options)
 View full example on GitHub
As of Internet Explorer Driver v4.5.0:

If IE is not present on the system (default in Windows 11), you do not need to use the two parameters above. IE Driver will use Edge and will automatically locate it.
If IE and Edge are both present on the system, you only need to set attaching to Edge, IE Driver will automatically locate Edge on your system.
So, if IE is not on the system, you only need:

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    driver = webdriver.Ie(options=options)
 View full example on GitHub
Here are a few common use cases with different capabilities:

fileUploadDialogTimeout
In some environments, Internet Explorer may timeout when opening the File Upload dialog. IEDriver has a default timeout of 1000ms, but you can increase the timeout using the fileUploadDialogTimeout capability.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    options.file_upload_timeout = 2000
 View full example on GitHub
ensureCleanSession
When set to true, this capability clears the Cache, Browser History and Cookies for all running instances of InternetExplorer including those started manually or by the driver. By default, it is set to false.

Using this capability will cause performance drop while launching the browser, as the driver will wait until the cache gets cleared before launching the IE browser.

This capability accepts a Boolean value as parameter.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    options.ensure_clean_session = True
 View full example on GitHub
ignoreZoomSetting
InternetExplorer driver expects the browser zoom level to be 100%, else the driver will throw an exception. This default behaviour can be disabled by setting the ignoreZoomSetting to true.

This capability accepts a Boolean value as parameter.

Move Code

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    options.ignore_zoom_level = True
 View full example on GitHub
ignoreProtectedModeSettings
Whether to skip the Protected Mode check while launching a new IE session.

If not set and Protected Mode settings are not same for all zones, an exception will be thrown by the driver.

If capability is set to true, tests may become flaky, unresponsive, or browsers may hang. However, this is still by far a second-best choice, and the first choice should always be to actually set the Protected Mode settings of each zone manually. If a user is using this property, only a “best effort” at support will be given.

This capability accepts a Boolean value as parameter.

Move Code

Java
Python

Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
    options = webdriver.IeOptions()
    options.ignore_protected_mode_settings = True

silent
When set to true, this capability suppresses the diagnostic output of the IEDriverServer.

This capability accepts a Boolean value as parameter.

Command-Line Options
Internet Explorer includes several command-line options that enable you to troubleshoot and configure the browser.

The following describes few supported command-line options

-private : Used to start IE in private browsing mode. This works for IE 8 and later versions.

-k : Starts Internet Explorer in kiosk mode. The browser opens in a maximized window that does not display the address bar, the navigation buttons, or the status bar.

-extoff : Starts IE in no add-on mode. This option specifically used to troubleshoot problems with browser add-ons. Works in IE 7 and later versions.

Note: forceCreateProcessApi should to enabled in-order for command line arguments to work.

forceCreateProcessApi
Forces launching Internet Explorer using the CreateProcess API. The default value is false.

For IE 8 and above, this option requires the “TabProcGrowth” registry value to be set to 0.

Errors
v4.0
Understanding Common Errors
How to solve various problems in your Selenium code.
InvalidSelectorException
CSS and XPath Selectors are sometimes difficult to get correct.

Likely Cause
The CSS or XPath selector you are trying to use has invalid characters or an invalid query.

Possible Solutions
Run your selector through a validator service:

CSS Validator
xPath Validator
Or use a browser extension to get a known good value:

SelectorsHub
NoSuchElementException
The element can not be found at the exact moment you attempted to locate it.

Likely Cause
You are looking for the element in the wrong place (perhaps a previous action was unsuccessful).
You are looking for the element at the wrong time (the element has not shown up in the DOM, yet)
The locator has changed since you wrote the code
Possible Solutions
Make sure you are on the page you expect to be on, and that previous actions in your code completed correctly
Make sure you are using a proper Waiting Strategy
Update the locator with the browser’s devtools console or use a browser extension like:
SelectorsHub
StaleElementReferenceException
An element goes stale when it was previously located, but can not be currently accessed. Elements do not get relocated automatically; the driver creates a reference ID for the element and has a particular place it expects to find it in the DOM. If it can not find the element in the current DOM, any action using that element will result in this exception.

Likely Cause
This can happen when:

You have refreshed the page, or the DOM of the page has dynamically changed.
You have navigated to a different page.
You have switched to another window or into or out of a frame or iframe.
Possible Solutions
The DOM has changed

When the page is refreshed or items on the page have moved around, there is still an element with the desired locator on the page, it is just no longer accessible by the element object being used, and the element must be relocated before it can be used again. This is often done in one of two ways:

Always relocate the element every time you go to use it. The likelihood of the element going stale in the microseconds between locating and using the element is small, though possible. The downside is that this is not the most efficient approach, especially when running on a remote grid.

Wrap the Web Element with another object that stores the locator, and caches the located Selenium element. When taking actions with this wrapped object, you can attempt to use the cached object if previously located, and if it is stale, exception can be caught, the element relocated with the stored locator, and the method re-tried. This is more efficient, but it can cause problems if the locator you’re using references a different element (and not the one you want) after the page has changed.

The Context has changed

Element objects are stored for a given context, so if you move to a different context — like a different window or a different frame or iframe — the element reference will still be valid, but will be temporarily inaccessible. In this scenario, it won’t help to relocate the element, because it doesn’t exist in the current context. To fix this, you need to make sure to switch back to the correct context before using the element.

The Page has changed

This scenario is when you haven’t just changed contexts, you have navigated to another page and have destroyed the context in which the element was located. You can’t just relocate it from the current context, and you can’t switch back to an active context where it is valid. If this is the reason for your error, you must both navigate back to the correct location and relocate it.

ElementClickInterceptedException
This exception occurs when Selenium tries to click an element, but the click would instead be received by a different element. Before Selenium will click an element, it checks if the element is visible, unobscured by any other elements, and enabled - if the element is obscured, it will raise this exception.

Likely Cause
UI Elements Overlapping

Elements on the UI are typically placed next to each other, but occasionally elements may overlap. For example, a navbar always staying at the top of your window as you scroll a page. If that navbar happens to be covering an element we are trying to click, Selenium might believe it to be visible and enabled, but when you try to click it will throw this exception. Pop-ups and Modals are also common offenders here.

Animations

Elements with animations have the potential to cause this exception as well - it is recommended to wait for animations to cease before attempting to click an element.

Possible Solutions
Use Explicit Waits

Explicit Waits will likely be your best friend in these instances. A great way is to use ExpectedCondition.ToBeClickable() with WebDriverWait to wait until the right moment.

Scroll the Element into View

In instances where the element is out of view, but Selenium still registers the element as visible (e.g. navbars overlapping a section at the top of your screen), you can use the WebDriver.executeScript() method to execute a javascript function to scroll (e.g. WebDriver.executeScript('window.scrollBy(0,-250)')) or you can utilize the Actions class with Actions.moveToElement(element).

InvalidSessionIdException
Sometimes the session you’re trying to access is different than what’s currently available

Likely Cause
This usually occurs when the session has been deleted (e.g. driver.quit()) or if the session has changed, like when the last tab/browser has closed (e.g. driver.close())

Possible Solutions
Check your script for instances of driver.close() and driver.quit(), and any other possible causes of closed tabs/browsers. It could be that you are locating an element before you should/can.

SessionNotCreatedException
This exception occurs when the WebDriver is unable to create a new session for the browser. This often happens due to version mismatches, system-level restrictions, or configuration issues.

Likely Cause
The browser version and WebDriver version are incompatible (e.g., ChromeDriver v113 with Chrome v115).
macOS privacy settings may block the WebDriver from running.
The WebDriver binary is missing, inaccessible, or lacks the necessary execution permissions (e.g., on Linux/macOS, the driver file may not be executable).
Possible Solutions
Ensure the WebDriver version matches the browser version. For Chrome, check the browser version at chrome://settings/help and download the matching driver from ChromeDriver Downloads.
On macOS, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security, and allow the driver to run if blocked.
Verify the driver binary is executable (chmod +x /path/to/driver on Linux/macOS).
ElementNotInteractableException
This exception occurs when Selenium tries to interact with an element that is not interactable in its current state.

Likely Cause
Unsupported Operation: Performing an action, like sendKeys, on an element that doesn’t support it (e.g., <form> or <label>).
Multiple Elements Matching Locator: The locator targets a non-interactable element, such as a <td> tag, instead of the intended <input> field.
Hidden Elements: The element is present in the DOM but not visible on the page due to CSS, the hidden attribute, or being outside the visible viewport.
Possible Solutions
Use actions appropriate for the element type (e.g., use sendKeys with <input> fields only).
Ensure locators uniquely identify the intended element to avoid incorrect matches.
Check if the element is visible on the page before interacting with it. Use scrolling to bring the element into view, if required.
Use explicit waits to ensure the element is interactable before performing actions.

Unable to Locate Driver Error
Troubleshooting missing path to driver executable.
Historically, this is the most common error beginning Selenium users get when trying to run code for the first time:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
The executable chromedriver needs to be available in the path.
Likely cause
Through WebDriver, Selenium supports all major browsers. In order to drive the requested browser, Selenium needs to send commands to it via an executable driver. This error means the necessary driver could not be found by any of the means Selenium attempts to use.

Possible solutions
There are several ways to ensure Selenium gets the driver it needs.

Use the latest version of Selenium
As of Selenium 4.6, Selenium downloads the correct driver for you. You shouldn’t need to do anything. If you are using the latest version of Selenium and you are getting an error, please turn on logging and file a bug report with that information.

If you want to read more information about how Selenium manages driver downloads for you, you can read about the Selenium Manager.

Use the PATH environment variable
This option first requires manually downloading the driver.

This is a flexible option to change location of drivers without having to update your code, and will work on multiple machines without requiring that each machine put the drivers in the same place.

You can either place the drivers in a directory that is already listed in PATH, or you can place them in a directory and add it to PATH.

Bash
Zsh
Windows
To see what directories are already on PATH, open a Terminal and execute:

echo $PATH
If the location to your driver is not already in a directory listed, you can add a new directory to PATH:

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/driver' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
You can test if it has been added correctly by checking the version of the driver:

chromedriver --version
Specify the location of the driver
If you cannot upgrade to the latest version of Selenium, you do not want Selenium to download drivers for you, and you can’t figure out the environment variables, you can specify the location of the driver in the Service object.

You first need to download the desired driver, then create an instance of the applicable Service class and set the path.

Specifying the location in the code itself has the advantage of not needing to figure out Environment Variables on your system, but has the drawback of making the code less flexible.

Driver management libraries
Before Selenium managed drivers itself, other projects were created to do so for you.

If you can’t use Selenium Manager because you are using an older version of Selenium (please upgrade), or need an advanced feature not yet implemented by Selenium Manager, you might try one of these tools to keep your drivers automatically updated:

WebDriverManager (Java)
WebDriver Manager (Python)
WebDriver Manager Package (.NET)
webdrivers gem (Ruby)

This "Unable to Locate Driver" error means Selenium cannot find the browser driver executable needed to interact with your browser.

✅ Solutions to Fix the Issue
1️⃣ Upgrade to Selenium 4.6+ (Recommended)
Since Selenium 4.6, it automatically downloads the required driver for your browser.

Make sure you are using the latest version of Selenium:

bash
Copy
pip install --upgrade selenium
2️⃣ Ensure the Driver is Installed & in PATH
Each browser requires a WebDriver executable:

Chrome → Chromedriver
Firefox → Geckodriver
Edge → EdgeDriver
Safari → Built-in, but run:
bash
Copy
safaridriver --enable
Check if the driver is installed:

bash
Copy
chromedriver --version
geckodriver --version
Add it to your PATH (Mac/Linux):

bash
Copy
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/driver
Add it to PATH (Windows):

Search "Environment Variables" → Edit PATH → Add the driver folder location.
3️⃣ Manually Specify Driver Location in Code
If you don’t want to modify PATH, specify the driver path in your script:

Python Example:

python
Copy
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

service = Service("/path/to/chromedriver")  # Specify full path
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service)
driver.get("https://www.google.com")
4️⃣ Use a Driver Management Library
If you can’t upgrade to Selenium 4.6, use webdriver-manager:

bash
Copy
pip install webdriver-manager
Then use:

python
Copy
from selenium import webdriver
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

driver = webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install())
🔥 Final Checklist
✅ Upgrade Selenium (pip install --upgrade selenium)
✅ Ensure WebDriver is installed & in PATH
✅ Manually specify driver path if needed
✅ Use webdriver-manager if running older Selenium

If you still have issues, what browser & OS are you using? 🚀

Logging
v4.0
Logging Selenium commands
Getting information about Selenium execution.
Turning on logging is a valuable way to get extra information that might help you determine why you might be having a problem.

Getting a logger
Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Python logs are typically created per module. You can match all submodules by referencing the top level module. So to work with all loggers in selenium module, you can do this:

    logger = logging.getLogger('selenium')
 View full example on GitHub
Logger level
Logger level helps to filter out logs based on their severity.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Python has 6 logger levels: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, and NOTSET. The default is WARNING

To change the level of the logger:

    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
 View full example on GitHub
Things get complicated when you use PyTest, though. By default, PyTest hides logging unless the test fails. You need to set 3 things to get PyTest to display logs on passing tests.

To always output logs with PyTest you need to run with additional arguments. First, -s to prevent PyTest from capturing the console. Second, -p no:logging, which allows you to override the default PyTest logging settings so logs can be displayed regardless of errors.

So you need to set these flags in your IDE, or run PyTest on command line like:

pytest -s -p no:logging
Finally, since you turned off logging in the arguments above, you now need to add configuration to turn it back on:

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARN)
Actionable items
Things are logged as warnings if they are something the user needs to take action on. This is often used for deprecations. For various reasons, Selenium project does not follow standard Semantic Versioning practices. Our policy is to mark things as deprecated for 3 releases and then remove them, so deprecations may be logged as warnings.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Python logs actionable content at logger level — WARNING Details about deprecations are logged at this level.

Example:

WARNING  selenium:test_logging.py:23 this is a warning
Useful information
This is the default level where Selenium logs things that users should be aware of but do not need to take actions on. This might reference a new method or direct users to more information about something

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Python logs useful information at logger level — INFO

Example:

INFO     selenium:test_logging.py:22 this is useful information
Debugging Details
The debug log level is used for information that may be needed for diagnosing issues and troubleshooting problems.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Python logs debugging details at logger level — DEBUG

Example:

DEBUG    selenium:test_logging.py:24 this is detailed debug information
Logger output
Logs can be displayed in the console or stored in a file. Different languages have different defaults.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
By default all logs are sent to sys.stderr. To direct output somewhere else, you need to add a handler with either a StreamHandler or a FileHandler:

    handler = logging.FileHandler(log_path)
    logger.addHandler(handler)
 View full example on GitHub
Logger filtering
Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
Because logging is managed by module, instead of working with just "selenium", you can specify different levels for different modules:
    logging.getLogger('selenium.webdriver.remote').setLevel(logging.WARN)
    logging.getLogger('selenium.webdriver.common').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

Troubleshooting
Upgrade to Selenium 4
v4.0
Upgrade to Selenium 4
Are you still using Selenium 3? This guide will help you upgrade to the latest release!
Upgrading to Selenium 4 should be a painless process if you are using one of the officially supported languages (Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Python, and Java). There might be some cases where a few issues can happen, and this guide will help you to sort them out. We will go through the steps to upgrade your project dependencies and understand the major deprecations and changes the version upgrade brings.

These are the steps we will follow to upgrade to Selenium 4:

Preparing our test code
Upgrading dependencies
Potential errors and deprecation messages
Note: while Selenium 3.x versions were being developed, support for the W3C WebDriver standard was implemented. Both this new protocol and the legacy JSON Wire Protocol were supported. Around version 3.11, Selenium code became compliant with the level W3C 1 specification. The W3C compliant code in the latest version of Selenium 3 will work as expected in Selenium 4.

Preparing our test code
Selenium 4 removes support for the legacy protocol and uses the W3C WebDriver standard by default under the hood. For most things, this implementation will not affect end users. The major exceptions are Capabilities and the Actions class.

Capabilities
If the test capabilities are not structured to be W3C compliant, may cause a session to not be started. Here is the list of W3C WebDriver standard capabilities:

browserName
browserVersion (replaces version)
platformName (replaces platform)
acceptInsecureCerts
pageLoadStrategy
proxy
timeouts
unhandledPromptBehavior
An up-to-date list of standard capabilities can be found at W3C WebDriver.

Any capability that is not contained in the list above, needs to include a vendor prefix. This applies to browser specific capabilities as well as cloud vendor specific capabilities. For example, if your cloud vendor uses build and name capabilities for your tests, you need to wrap them in a cloud:options block (check with your cloud vendor for the appropriate prefix).

Before
Move Code

Java
JavaScript
CSharp
Ruby
Python
caps = {}
caps['browserName'] = 'firefox'
caps['platform'] = 'Windows 10'
caps['version'] = '92'
caps['build'] = my_test_build
caps['name'] = my_test_name
driver = webdriver.Remote(cloud_url, desired_capabilities=caps)
After
Move Code

Java
JavaScript
CSharp
Ruby
Python
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options as FirefoxOptions
options = FirefoxOptions()
options.browser_version = '92'
options.platform_name = 'Windows 10'
cloud_options = {}
cloud_options['build'] = my_test_build
cloud_options['name'] = my_test_name
options.set_capability('cloud:options', cloud_options)
driver = webdriver.Remote(cloud_url, options=options)
Find element(s) utility methods in Java
The utility methods to find elements in the Java bindings (FindsBy interfaces) have been removed as they were meant for internal use only. The following code samples explain this better.

Finding a single element with findElement*

Before

driver.findElementByClassName("className");
driver.findElementByCssSelector(".className");
driver.findElementById("elementId");
driver.findElementByLinkText("linkText");
driver.findElementByName("elementName");
driver.findElementByPartialLinkText("partialText");
driver.findElementByTagName("elementTagName");
driver.findElementByXPath("xPath");
After

driver.findElement(By.className("className"));
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(".className"));
driver.findElement(By.id("elementId"));
driver.findElement(By.linkText("linkText"));
driver.findElement(By.name("elementName"));
driver.findElement(By.partialLinkText("partialText"));
driver.findElement(By.tagName("elementTagName"));
driver.findElement(By.xpath("xPath"));
Finding a multiple elements with findElements*

Before

driver.findElementsByClassName("className");
driver.findElementsByCssSelector(".className");
driver.findElementsById("elementId");
driver.findElementsByLinkText("linkText");
driver.findElementsByName("elementName");
driver.findElementsByPartialLinkText("partialText");
driver.findElementsByTagName("elementTagName");
driver.findElementsByXPath("xPath");
After

driver.findElements(By.className("className"));
driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(".className"));
driver.findElements(By.id("elementId"));
driver.findElements(By.linkText("linkText"));
driver.findElements(By.name("elementName"));
driver.findElements(By.partialLinkText("partialText"));
driver.findElements(By.tagName("elementTagName"));
driver.findElements(By.xpath("xPath"));
Upgrading dependencies
Check the subsections below to install Selenium 4 and have your project dependencies upgraded.

Java
The process of upgrading Selenium depends on which build tool is being used. We will cover the most common ones for Java, which are Maven and Gradle. The minimum Java version required is still 8.

C#
The place to get updates for Selenium 4 in C# is NuGet. Under the Selenium.WebDriver package you can get the instructions to update to the latest version. Inside of Visual Studio, through the NuGet Package Manager you can execute:

PM> Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver -Version 4.4.0
Python
The most important change to use Python is the minimum required version. Selenium 4 will require a minimum Python 3.7 or higher. More details can be found at the Python Package Index. To upgrade from the command line, you can execute:

pip install selenium==4.4.3
Ruby
The update details for Selenium 4 can be seen at the selenium-webdriver gem in RubyGems. To install the latest version, you can execute:

gem install selenium-webdriver
To add it to your Gemfile:

gem 'selenium-webdriver', '~> 4.4.0'
JavaScript
The selenium-webdriver package can be found at the Node package manager, npmjs. Selenium 4 can be found here. To install it, you could either execute:

npm install selenium-webdriver
Or, update your package.json and run npm install:

{
  "name": "selenium-tests",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "selenium-webdriver": "^4.4.0"
  }
}
Potential errors and deprecation messages
Here is a set of code examples that will help to overcome the deprecation messages you might encounter after upgrading to Selenium 4.

Java
Waits and Timeout
The parameters received in Timeout have switched from expecting (long time, TimeUnit unit) to expect (Duration duration).

Before

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
driver.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(2, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
After

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
driver.manage().timeouts().scriptTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(2));
driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
Waits are also expecting different parameters now. WebDriverWait is now expecting a Duration instead of a long for timeout in seconds and milliseconds. The withTimeout and pollingEvery utility methods from FluentWait have switched from expecting (long time, TimeUnit unit) to expect (Duration duration).

Before

new WebDriverWait(driver, 3)
.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.cssSelector("#id")));

Wait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<WebDriver>(driver)
  .withTimeout(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
  .pollingEvery(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
  .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);
After

new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(3))
  .until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.cssSelector("#id")));

  Wait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<WebDriver>(driver)
  .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
  .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
  .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);
Merging capabilities is no longer changing the calling object
It was possible to merge a different set of capabilities into another set, and it was mutating the calling object. Now, the result of the merge operation needs to be assigned.

Before

MutableCapabilities capabilities = new MutableCapabilities();
capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion", "Windows 10");
FirefoxOptions options = new FirefoxOptions();
options.setHeadless(true);
options.merge(capabilities);

// As a result, the options object was getting modified.
After

MutableCapabilities capabilities = new MutableCapabilities();
capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion", "Windows 10");
FirefoxOptions options = new FirefoxOptions();
options.setHeadless(true);
options = options.merge(capabilities);

// The result of the merge call needs to be assigned to an object.
Firefox Legacy
Before GeckoDriver was around, the Selenium project had a driver implementation to automate Firefox (version <48). However, this implementation is not needed anymore as it does not work in recent versions of Firefox. To avoid major issues when upgrading to Selenium 4, the setLegacy option will be shown as deprecated. The recommendation is to stop using the old implementation and rely only on GeckoDriver. The following code will show the setLegacy line deprecated after upgrading.

FirefoxOptions options = new FirefoxOptions();
options.setLegacy(true);
BrowserType
The BrowserType interface has been around for a long time, however it is getting deprecated in favour of the new Browser interface.

Before

MutableCapabilities capabilities = new MutableCapabilities();
capabilities.setCapability("browserVersion", "92");
capabilities.setCapability("browserName", BrowserType.FIREFOX);
After

MutableCapabilities capabilities = new MutableCapabilities();
capabilities.setCapability("browserVersion", "92");
capabilities.setCapability("browserName", Browser.FIREFOX);
C#
AddAdditionalCapability is deprecated
Instead of it, AddAdditionalOption is recommended. Here is an example showing this:

Before

var browserOptions = new ChromeOptions();
browserOptions.PlatformName = "Windows 10";
browserOptions.BrowserVersion = "latest";
var cloudOptions = new Dictionary<string, object>();
browserOptions.AddAdditionalCapability("cloud:options", cloudOptions, true);
After

var browserOptions = new ChromeOptions();
browserOptions.PlatformName = "Windows 10";
browserOptions.BrowserVersion = "latest";
var cloudOptions = new Dictionary<string, object>();
browserOptions.AddAdditionalOption("cloud:options", cloudOptions);
Python
executable_path has been deprecated, please pass in a Service object
In Selenium 4, you’ll need to set the driver’s executable_path from a Service object to prevent deprecation warnings. (Or don’t set the path and instead make sure that the driver you need is on the System PATH.)

Before

from selenium import webdriver
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
driver = webdriver.Chrome(
    executable_path=CHROMEDRIVER_PATH, 
    options=options
)
After

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service as ChromeService
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
service = ChromeService(executable_path=CHROMEDRIVER_PATH)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=options)
Summary
We went through the major changes to be taken into consideration when upgrading to Selenium 4. Covering the different aspects to cover when test code is prepared for the upgrade, including suggestions on how to prevent potential issues that can show up when using the new version of Selenium. To finalize, we also covered a set of possible issues that you can bump into after upgrading, and we shared potential fixes for those issues.

Selenium Manager
v4.0
Selenium Manager (Beta)
Selenium Manager is a command-line tool implemented in Rust that provides automated driver and browser management for Selenium. Selenium bindings use this tool by default, so you do not need to download it or add anything to your code or do anything else to use it.
Motivation
TL;DR: Selenium Manager is the official driver manager of the Selenium project, and it is shipped out of the box with every Selenium release.

Selenium uses the native support implemented by each browser to carry out the automation process. For this reason, Selenium users need to place a component called driver (chromedriver, geckodriver, msedgedriver, etc.) between the script using the Selenium API and the browser. For many years, managing these drivers was a manual process for Selenium users. This way, they had to download the required driver for a browser (chromedriver for Chrome, geckodriver for Firefox, etc.) and place it in the PATH or export the driver path as a system property (Java, JavaScript, etc.). But this process was cumbersome and led to maintainability issues.

Let’s consider an example. Imagine you manually downloaded the required chromedriver for driving your Chrome with Selenium. When you did this process, the stable version of Chrome was 113, so you downloaded chromedriver 113 and put it in your PATH. At that moment, your Selenium script executed correctly. But the problem is that Chrome is evergreen. This name refers to Chrome’s ability to upgrade automatically and silently to the next stable version when available. This feature is excellent for end-users but potentially dangerous for browser automation. Let’s go back to the example to discover it. Your local Chrome eventually updates to version 115. And that moment, your Selenium script is broken due to the incompatibility between the manually downloaded driver (113) and the Chrome version (115). Thus, your Selenium script fails with the following error message: “session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 113”.

This problem is the primary reason for the existence of the so-called driver managers (such as WebDriverManager for Java, webdriver-manager for Python, webdriver-manager for JavaScript, WebDriverManager.Net for C#, and webdrivers for Ruby). All these projects were an inspiration and a clear sign that the community needed this feature to be built in Selenium. Thus, the Selenium project has created Selenium Manager, the official driver manager for Selenium, shipped out of the box with each Selenium release as of version 4.6.

Usage
TL;DR: Selenium Manager is used by the Selenium bindings when the drivers (chromedriver, geckodriver, etc.) are unavailable.

Driver management through Selenium Manager is opt-in for the Selenium bindings. Thus, users can continue managing their drivers manually (putting the driver in the PATH or using system properties) or rely on a third-party driver manager to do it automatically. Selenium Manager only operates as a fallback: if no driver is provided, Selenium Manager will come to the rescue.

Selenium Manager is a CLI (command line interface) tool implemented in Rust to allow cross-platform execution and compiled for Windows, Linux, and macOS. The Selenium Manager binaries are shipped with each Selenium release. This way, each Selenium binding language invokes Selenium Manager to carry out the automated driver and browser management explained in the following sections.

Automated driver management
TL;DR: Selenium Manager automatically discovers, downloads, and caches the drivers required by Selenium when these drivers are unavailable.

The primary feature of Selenium Manager is called automated driver management. Let’s consider an example to understand it. Suppose we want to driver Chrome with Selenium (see the doc about how to start a session with Selenium). Before the session begins, and when the driver is unavailable, Selenium Manager manages chromedriver for us. We use the term management for this feature (and not just download) since this process is broader and implies different steps:

Browser version discovery. Selenium Manager discovers the browser version (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) installed in the machine that executes Selenium. This step uses shell commands (e.g., google-chrome --version).
Driver version discovery. With the discovered browser version, the proper driver version is resolved. For this step, the online metadata/endpoints maintained by the browser vendors (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver, or msedgedriver) are used.
Driver download. The driver URL is obtained with the resolved driver version; with that URL, the driver artifact is downloaded, uncompressed, and stored locally.
Driver cache. Uncompressed driver binaries are stored in a local cache folder (~/.cache/selenium). The next time the same driver is required, it will be used from there if the driver is already in the cache.
Automated browser management
TL;DR: Selenium Manager automatically discovers, downloads, and caches the browsers driven with Selenium (Chrome, Firefox, and Edge) when these browsers are not installed in the local system.

As of Selenium 4.11.0, Selenium Manager also implements automated browser management. With this feature, Selenium Manager allows us to discover, download, and cache the different browser releases, making them seamlessly available for Selenium. Internally, Selenium Manager uses an equivalent management procedure explained in the section before, but this time, for browser releases.

The browser automatically managed by Selenium Manager are:

Chrome. Based on Chrome for Testing (CfT), as of Selenium 4.11.0.
Firefox. Based on public Firefox releases, as of Selenium 4.12.0.
Edge. Based on Edge downloads, as of Selenium 4.14.0.
Let’s consider again the typical example of driving Chrome with Selenium. And this time, suppose Chrome is not installed on the local machine when starting a new session). In that case, the current stable CfT release will be discovered, downloaded, and cached (in ~/.cache/selenium/chrome) by Selenium Manager.

But there is more. In addition to the stable browser version, Selenium Manager also allows downloading older browser versions (in the case of CfT, starting in version 113, the first version published as CfT). To set a browser version with Selenium, we use a browser option called browserVersion.

Let’s consider another simple example. Suppose we set browserVersion to 114 using Chrome options. In this case, Selenium Manager will check if Chrome 114 is already installed. If it is, it will be used. If not, Selenium Manager will manage (i.e., discover, download, and cache) CfT 114. And in either case, the chromedriver is also managed. Finally, Selenium will start Chrome to be driven programmatically, as usual.

But there is even more. In addition to fixed browser versions (e.g., 113, 114, 115, etc.), we can use the following labels for browserVersion:

stable: Current CfT version.
beta: Next version to stable.
dev: Version in development at this moment.
canary: Nightly build for developers.
esr: Extended Support Release (only for Firefox).
When these labels are specified, Selenium Manager first checks if a given browser is already installed (beta, dev, etc.), and when it is not detected, the browser is automatically managed.

Edge in Windows
Automated Edge management by Selenium Manager in Windows is different from other browsers. Both Chrome and Firefox (and Edge in macOS and Linux) are downloaded automatically to the local cache (~/.cache/selenium) by Selenium Manager. Nevertheless, the same cannot be done for Edge in Windows. The reason is that the Edge installer for Windows is distributed as a Microsoft Installer (MSI) file, designed to be executed with administrator rights. This way, when Edge is attempted to be installed with Selenium Manager in Windows with a non-administrator session, a warning message will be displayed by Selenium Manager as follows:

edge can only be installed in Windows with administrator permissions
Therefore, administrator permissions are required to install Edge in Windows automatically through Selenium Manager, and Edge is eventually installed in the usual program files folder (e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge).

Data collection
Selenium Manager will report anonymised usage statistics to Plausible. This allows the Selenium team to understand more about how Selenium is being used so that we can better focus our development efforts. The data being collected is:

Data	Purpose
Selenium version	This allows the Selenium developers to safely deprecate and remove features, as well as determine which new features may be available to you
Language binding	Programming language used to execute Selenium scripts (Java, JavaScript, Python, .Net, Ruby)
OS and architecture Selenium Manager is running on	The Selenium developers can use this information to help prioritise bug reports, and to identify if there are systemic OS-related issues
Browser and browser version	Helping for prioritising bug reports
Rough geolocation	Derived from the IP address you connect from. This is useful for determining where we need to focus our documentation efforts
Selenium Manager sends these data to Plausible once a day. This period is based on the TTL value (see configuration).

Opting out of data collection
Data collection is on by default. To disable it, set the SE_AVOID_STATS environment variable to true. You may also disable data collection in the configuration file (see below) by setting avoid-stats = true.

Configuration
TL;DR: Selenium Manager should work silently and transparently for most users. Nevertheless, there are scenarios (e.g., to specify a custom cache path or setup globally a proxy) where custom configuration can be required.

Selenium Manager is a CLI tool. Therefore, under the hood, the Selenium bindings call Selenium Manager by invoking shell commands. Like any other CLI tool, arguments can be used to specify specific capabilities in Selenium Manager. The different arguments supported by Selenium Manager can be checked by running the following command:

$ ./selenium-manager --help
In addition to CLI arguments, Selenium Manager allows two additional mechanisms for configuration:

Configuration file. Selenium Manager uses a file called se-config.toml located in the Selenium cache (by default, at ~/.cache/selenium) for custom configuration values. This TOML file contains a key-value collection used for custom configuration.
Environmental variables. Each configuration key has its equivalence in environmental variables by converting each key name to uppercase, replacing the dash symbol (-) with an underscore (_), and adding the prefix SE_.
The configuration file is honored by Selenium Manager when it is present, and the corresponding CLI parameter is not specified. Besides, the environmental variables are used when neither of the previous options (CLI arguments and configuration file) is specified. In other words, the order of preference for Selenium Manager custom configuration is as follows:

CLI arguments.
Configuration file.
Environment variables.
Notice that the Selenium bindings use the CLI arguments to specify configuration values, which in turn, are defined in each binding using browser options.

The following table summarizes all the supported arguments supported by Selenium Manager and their correspondence key in the configuration file and environment variables.

In addition to the configuration keys specified in the table before, there are some special cases, namely:

Browser version. In addition to browser-version, we can use the specific configuration keys to specify custom versions per supported browser. This way, the keys chrome-version, firefox-version, edge-version, etc., are supported. The same applies to environment variables (i.e., SE_CHROME_VERSION, SE_FIREFOX_VERSION, SE_EDGE_VERSION, etc.).
Driver version. Following the same pattern, we can use chromedriver-version, geckodriver-version, msedgedriver-version, etc. (in the configuration file), and SE_CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION, SE_GECKODRIVER_VERSION, SE_MSEDGEDRIVER_VERSION, etc. (as environment variables).
Browser path. Following the same pattern, we can use chrome-path, firefox-path, edge-path, etc. (in the configuration file), and SE_CHROME_PATH, SE_FIREFOX_PATH, SE_EDGE_PATH, etc. (as environment variables). The Selenium bindings also allow to specify a custom location of the browser path using options, namely: Chrome), Edge, or Firefox.
Driver mirror. Following the same pattern, we can use chromedriver-mirror-url, geckodriver-mirror-url, msedgedriver-mirror-url, etc. (in the configuration file), and SE_CHROMEDRIVER_MIRROR_URL, SE_GECKODRIVER_MIRROR_URL, SE_MSEDGEDRIVER_MIRROR_URL, etc. (as environment variables).
Browser mirror. Following the same pattern, we can use chrome-mirror-url, firefox-mirror-url, edge-mirror-url, etc. (in the configuration file), and SE_CHROME_MIRROR_URL, SE_FIREFOX_MIRROR_URL, SE_EDGE_MIRROR_URL, etc. (as environment variables).

Caching
TL;DR: The drivers and browsers managed by Selenium Manager are stored in a local folder (~/.cache/selenium).

The cache in Selenium Manager is a local folder (~/.cache/selenium by default) in which the downloaded assets (drivers and browsers) are stored. For the sake of performance, when a driver or browser is already in the cache (i.e., there is a cache hint), Selenium Manager uses it from there.

In addition to the downloaded drivers and browsers, two additional files live in the cache’s root:

Configuration file (se-config.toml). This file is optional and, as explained in the previous section, allows to store custom configuration values for Selenium Manager. This file is maintained by the end-user and read by Selenium Manager.
Metadata file (se-metadata.json). This file contains versions discovered by Selenium Manger making network requests (e.g., using the CfT JSON endpoints) and the time-to-live (TTL) in which they are valid. Selenium Manager automatically maintains this file.
The TTL in Selenium Manager is inspired by the TTL for DNS, a well-known mechanism that refers to how long some values are cached before they are automatically refreshed. In the case of Selenium Manager, these values are the versions found by making network requests for driver and browser version discovery. By default, the TTL is 3600 seconds (i.e., 1 hour) and can be tuned using configuration values or disabled by setting this configuration value to 0.

The TTL mechanism is a way to improve the overall performance of Selenium. It is based on the fact that the discovered driver and browser versions (e.g., the proper chromedriver version for Chrome 115 is 115.0.5790.170) will likely remain the same in the short term. Therefore, the discovered versions are written in the metadata file and read from there instead of making the same consecutive network request. This way, during the driver version discovery (step 2 of the automated driver management process previously introduced), Selenium Manager first reads the file metadata. When a fresh resolution (i.e., a driver/browser version valid during a TTL) is found, that version is used (saving some time in making a new network request). If not found or the TTL has expired, a network request is made, and the result is stored in the metadata file.

Let’s consider an example. A Selenium binding asks Selenium Manager to resolve chromedriver. Selenium Manager detects that Chrome 115 is installed, so it makes a network request to the CfT endpoints to discover the proper chromedriver version (115.0.5790.170, at that moment). This version is stored in the metadata file and considered valid during the next hour (TTL). If Selenium Manager is asked to resolve chromedriver during that time (which is likely to happen in the execution of a test suite), the chromedriver version is discovered by reading the metadata file instead of making a new request to the CfT endpoints. After one hour, the chromedriver version stored in the cache will be considered as stale, and Selenium Manager will refresh it by making a new network request to the corresponding endpoint.

Selenium Manager includes two additional arguments two handle the cache, namely:

--clear-cache: To remove the cache folder (equivalent to the environment variable SE_CLEAR_CACHE=true).
--clear-metadata: To remove the metadata file (equivalent to the environment variable SE_CLEAR_METADATA=true).
Versioning
Selenium Manager follows the same versioning schema as Selenium. Nevertheless, we use the major version 0 for Selenium Manager releases because it is still in beta. For example, the Selenium Manager binaries shipped with Selenium 4.12.0 corresponds to version 0.4.12.

Getting Selenium Manager
For most users, direct interaction with Selenium Manager is not required since the Selenium bindings use it internally. Nevertheless, if you want to play with Selenium Manager or use it for your use case involving driver or browser management, you can get the Selenium Manager binaries in different ways:

From the Selenium repository. The Selenium Manager source code is stored in the main Selenium repo under the folder rust. Moreover, you can find the compiled versions for Windows, Linux, and macOS in the Selenium Manager Artifacts repo. The stable Selenium Manager binaries (i.e., those distributed in the latest stable Selenium version) are linked in this file.
From the build workflow. Selenium Manager is compiled using a GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow creates binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS. You can download these binaries from these workflow executions.
From the cache. As of version 4.15.0 of the Selenium Java bindings, the Selenium Manager binary is extracted and copied to the cache folder. For instance, the Selenium Manager binary shipped with Selenium 4.15.0 is stored in the folder ~/.cache/selenium/manager/0.4.15).

Let’s consider a typical example: we want to manage chromedriver automatically. For that, we invoke Selenium Manager as follows (notice that the flag --debug is optional, but it helps us to understand what Selenium Manager is doing):

$ ./selenium-manager --browser chrome --debug
DEBUG   chromedriver not found in PATH
DEBUG   chrome detected at C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
DEBUG   Running command: wmic datafile where name='C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe' get Version /value
DEBUG   Output: "\r\r\n\r\r\nVersion=116.0.5845.111\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r"
DEBUG   Detected browser: chrome 116.0.5845.111
DEBUG   Discovering versions from https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/known-good-versions-with-downloads.json
DEBUG   Required driver: chromedriver 116.0.5845.96
DEBUG   Downloading chromedriver 116.0.5845.96 from https://edgedl.me.gvt1.com/edgedl/chrome/chrome-for-testing/116.0.5845.96/win64/chromedriver-win64.zip
INFO    Driver path: C:\Users\boni\.cache\selenium\chromedriver\win64\116.0.5845.96\chromedriver.exe
INFO    Browser path: C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
In this case, the local Chrome (in Windows) is detected by Selenium Manager. Then, using its version and the CfT endpoints, the proper chromedriver version (115, in this example) is downloaded to the local cache. Finally, Selenium Manager provides two results: i) the driver path (downloaded) and ii) the browser path (local).

Let’s consider another example. Now we want to use Chrome beta. Therefore, we invoke Selenium Manager specifying that version label as follows (notice that the CfT beta is discovered, downloaded, and stored in the local cache):

$ ./selenium-manager --browser chrome --browser-version beta --debug
DEBUG   chromedriver not found in PATH
DEBUG   chrome not found in PATH
DEBUG   chrome beta not found in the system
DEBUG   Discovering versions from https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/last-known-good-versions-with-downloads.json

Selenium Grid
Selenium Manager allows you to configure the drivers automatically when setting up Selenium Grid. To that aim, you need to include the argument --selenium-manager true in the command to start Selenium Grid. For more details, visit the Selenium Grid starting page.

Moreover, Selenium Manager also allows managing Selenium Grid releases automatically. For that, the argument --grid is used as follows:

$ ./selenium-manager --grid
After this command, Selenium Manager discovers the latest version of Selenium Grid, storing the selenium-server.jar in the local cache.

Optionally, the argument --grid allows to specify a Selenium Grid version (--grid <GRID_VERSION>).

Known Limitations
Connectivity issues
Selenium Manager requests remote endpoints (like Chrome for Testing (CfT), among others) to discover and download drivers and browsers from online repositories. When this operation is done in a corporate environment with a proxy or firewall, it might lead to connectivity problems like the following:

error sending request for url (https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/known-good-versions-with-downloads.json)
error trying to connect: dns error: failed to lookup address information
error trying to connect: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. (os error 10054)
When that happens, consider the following solutions:

Use the proxy capabilities of Selenium (see documentation). Alternatively, use the environment variable SE_PROXY to set the proxy URL or use the configuration file (see configuration).
Review your network setup to enable the remote requests and downloads required by Selenium Manager.
Custom package managers
If you are using a Linux package manager (Anaconda, snap, etc) that requires a specific driver be used for your browsers, you’ll need to either specify the driver location, the browser location, or both, depending on the requirements.

Alternative architectures
Selenium supports all five architectures managed by Google’s Chrome for Testing, and all six drivers provided for Microsoft Edge.

Each release of the Selenium bindings comes with three separate Selenium Manager binaries — one for Linux, Windows, and Mac.

The Mac version supports both x64 and aarch64 (Intel and Apple).
The Windows version should work for both x86 and x64 (32-bit and 64-bit OS).
The Linux version has only been verified to work for x64.
Reasons for not supporting more architectures:

Neither Chrome for Testing nor Microsoft Edge supports additional architectures, so Selenium Manager would need to manage something unofficial for it to work.
We currently build the binaries from existing GitHub actions runners, which do not support these architectures
Any additional architectures would get distributed with all Selenium releases, increasing the total build size
If you are running Linux on arm64/aarch64, 32-bit architecture, or a Raspberry Pi, Selenium Manager will not work for you. The biggest issue for people is that they used to get custom-built drivers and put them on PATH and have them work. Now that Selenium Manager is responsible for locating drivers on PATH, this approach no longer works, and users need to use a Service class and set the location directly. There are a number of advantages to having Selenium Manager look for drivers on PATH instead of managing that logic in each of the bindings, so that’s currently a trade-off we are comfortable with.

However, as of Selenium 4.13.0, the Selenium bindings allow locating the Selenium Manager binary using an environment variable called SE_MANAGER_PATH. If this variable is set, the bindings will use its value as the Selenium Manager path in the local filesystem. This feature will allow users to provide a custom compilation of Selenium Manager, for instance, if the default binaries (compiled for Windows, Linux, and macOS) are incompatible with a given system (e.g., ARM64 in Linux).

Browser dependencies
When automatically managing browsers in Linux, Selenium Manager relies on the releases published by the browser vendors (i.e., Chrome, Firefox, and Edge). These releases are portable in most cases. Nevertheless, there might be cases in which existing libraries are required. In Linux, this problem might be experienced when trying to run Firefox, e.g., as follows:

libdbus-glib-1.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Couldn't load XPCOM.
If that happens, the solution is to install that library, for instance, as follows:

sudo apt-get install libdbus-glib-1-2
A similar issue might happen when trying to execute Chrome for Testing in Linux:

error while loading shared libraries: libatk-1.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
In this case, the library to be installed is the following:

sudo apt-get install libatk-bridge2.0-0
Using an environment variable for the driver path
It’s possible to use an environment variable to specify the driver path without using Selenium Manager. The following environment variables are supported:

SE_CHROMEDRIVER
SE_EDGEDRIVER
SE_GECKODRIVER
SE_IEDRIVER
SE_SAFARIDRIVER
For example, to specify the path to the chromedriver, you can set the SE_CHROMEDRIVER environment variable to the path of the chromedriver executable. The following bindings allow you to specify the driver path using an environment variable:

Ruby
Java
Python
This feature is available in the Selenium Ruby binding starting from version 4.25.0 and in the Python binding from version 4.26.0.

Building a Custom Selenium Manager
In order to build your own custom Selenium Manager that works in an architecture we don’t currently support, you can utilize the following steps:

Install Rust Dev Environment
clone Selenium onto your local machine git clone https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium.git --depth 1
Navigate into your clone cd selenium/rust
Build selenium cargo build --release
Set the following environment variable for the driver path SE_MANAGER_PATH=~/selenium/rust/target/release/selenium-manager
Put the driver you want in a location on your system PATH
Selenium will now use the built Selenium Manager to locate the manually downloaded driver on PATH

Getting Started
v4.0
Getting started with Selenium Grid
Instructions for a simple Selenium Grid
Quick start
Prerequisites
Java 11 or higher installed
Browser(s) installed
Browser driver(s)
Selenium Manager will configure the drivers automatically if you add --selenium-manager true.
Installed and on the PATH
Download the Selenium Server jar file from the latest release
Start the Grid
java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar standalone
Point* your WebDriver tests to http://localhost:4444
(Optional) Check running tests and available capabilities by opening your browser at http://localhost:4444
*Wondering how to point your tests to http://localhost:4444? Check the RemoteWebDriver section.

To learn more about the different configuration options, go through the sections below.

Grid roles
Grid is composed by six different components, which gives you the option to deploy it in different ways.

Depending on your needs, you can start each one of them on its own (Distributed), group them in Hub & Node, or all in one on a single machine (Standalone).

Standalone
Standalone combines all Grid components seamlessly into one. Running a Grid in Standalone mode gives you a fully functional Grid with a single command, within a single process. Standalone can only run on a single machine.

Standalone is also the easiest mode to spin up a Selenium Grid. By default, the server will listen for RemoteWebDriver requests on http://localhost:4444. By default, the server will detect the available drivers that it can use from the System PATH.

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar standalone
After starting successfully the Grid in Standalone mode, point your WebDriver tests to http://localhost:4444.

Common use cases for Standalone are:

Develop or debug tests using RemoteWebDriver locally
Running quick test suites before pushing code
Have a easy to setup Grid in a CI/CD tool (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc…)
Hub and Node
Hub and Node is the most used role because it allows to:

Combine different machines in a single Grid
Machines with different operating systems and/or browser versions, for example
Have a single entry point to run WebDriver tests in different environments
Scaling capacity up or down without tearing down the Grid
Hub
A Hub is composed by the following components: Router, Distributor, Session Map, New Session Queue, and Event Bus.

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar hub
By default, the server will listen for RemoteWebDriver requests on http://localhost:4444.

Node
During startup time, the Node will detect the available drivers that it can use from the System PATH.

The command below assumes the Node is running on the same machine where the Hub is running.

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node
More than one Node on the same machine
Node 1

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --port 5555
Node 2

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --port 6666
Node and Hub on different machines
Hub and Nodes talk to each other via HTTP and the Event Bus (the Event Bus lives inside the Hub). A Node sends a message to the Hub via the Event Bus to start the registration process. When the Hub receives the message, reaches out to the Node via HTTP to confirm its existence.

To successfully register a Node to a Hub, it is important to expose the Event Bus ports (4442 and 4443 by default) on the Hub machine. This also applies for the Node port. With that, both Hub and Node will be able to communicate.

If the Hub is using the default ports, the --hub flag can be used to register the Node

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --hub http://<hub-ip>:4444
When the Hub is not using the default ports, the --publish-events and --subscribe-events flags are needed.

For example, if the Hub uses ports 8886, 8887, and 8888

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar hub --publish-events tcp://<hub-ip>:8886 --subscribe-events tcp://<hub-ip>:8887 --port 8888
The Node needs to use those ports to register successfully

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --publish-events tcp://<hub-ip>:8886 --subscribe-events tcp://<hub-ip>:8887
Distributed
When using a Distributed Grid, each component is started separately, and ideally on different machines.

It is important to expose all ports properly in order to allow fluent communication between all components.
Event Bus: enables internal communication between different Grid components.
Default ports are: 4442, 4443, and 5557.

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar event-bus --publish-events tcp://<event-bus-ip>:4442 --subscribe-events tcp://<event-bus-ip>:4443 --port 5557
New Session Queue: adds new session requests to a queue, which will be queried by the Distributor
Default port is 5559.

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar sessionqueue --port 5559
Session Map: maps session IDs to the Node where the session is running
Default Session Map port is 5556. Session Map interacts with the Event Bus.

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar sessions --publish-events tcp://<event-bus-ip>:4442 --subscribe-events tcp://<event-bus-ip>:4443 --port 5556
Distributor: queries the New Session Queue for new session requests, and assigns them to a Node when the capabilities match. Nodes register to the Distributor the way they register to the Hub in a Hub/Node Grid.
Default Distributor port is 5553. Distributor interacts with New Session Queue, Session Map, Event Bus, and the Node(s).

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar distributor --publish-events tcp://<event-bus-ip>:4442 --subscribe-events tcp://<event-bus-ip>:4443 --sessions http://<sessions-ip>:5556 --sessionqueue http://<new-session-queue-ip>:5559 --port 5553 --bind-bus false
Router: redirects new session requests to the queue, and redirects running sessions requests to the Node running that session.
Default Router port is 4444. Router interacts with New Session Queue, Session Map, and Distributor.

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar router --sessions http://<sessions-ip>:5556 --distributor http://<distributor-ip>:5553 --sessionqueue http://<new-session-queue-ip>:5559 --port 4444
Node(s)
Default Node port is 5555.

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --publish-events tcp://<event-bus-ip>:4442 --subscribe-events tcp://<event-bus-ip>:4443
Metadata in tests
Add metadata to your tests and consume it via GraphQL or visualize parts of it (like se:name) through the Selenium Grid UI.

Metadata can be added by prefixing a capability with se:. Here is a quick example in Java showing that.

ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions();
chromeOptions.setCapability("browserVersion", "100");
chromeOptions.setCapability("platformName", "Windows");
// Showing a test name instead of the session id in the Grid UI
chromeOptions.setCapability("se:name", "My simple test"); 
// Other type of metadata can be seen in the Grid UI by clicking on the 
// session info or via GraphQL
chromeOptions.setCapability("se:sampleMetadata", "Sample metadata value"); 
WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://gridUrl:4444"), chromeOptions);
driver.get("http://www.google.com");
driver.quit();
Querying Selenium Grid
After starting a Grid, there are mainly two ways of querying its status, through the Grid UI or via an API call.

The Grid UI can be reached by opening your preferred browser and heading to http://localhost:4444.

API calls can be done through the http://localhost:4444/status endpoint or using GraphQL

For simplicity, all command examples shown in this page assume that components are running locally. More detailed examples and usages can be found in the Configuring Components section.

Using the Java 11 HTTP Client
Selenium v4.5

By default, Grid will use AsyncHttpClient. AsyncHttpClient is an open-source library built on top of Netty. It allows the execution of HTTP requests and responses asynchronously. Additionally it also provides WebSocket support. Hence it is a good fit.

However, AsyncHttpClient is not been actively maintained since June 2021. It coincides with the fact that Java 11+ provides a built-in HTTP and WebSocket client. Currently, Selenium has plans to upgrade the minimum version supported to Java 11. However, it is a sizeable effort. Aligning it with major releases and accompanied announcements is crucial to ensure the user experience is intact.

To do use the Java 11 client, you will need to download the selenium-http-jdk-client jar file and use the --ext flag to make it available in the Grid jar’s classpath.

The jar file can be downloaded directly from repo1.maven.org and then start the Grid in the following way:

java -Dwebdriver.http.factory=jdk-http-client -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar --ext selenium-http-jdk-client-<version>.jar standalone
An alternative to downloading the selenium-http-jdk-client jar file is to use Coursier.

java -Dwebdriver.http.factory=jdk-http-client -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar --ext $(coursier fetch -p org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-http-jdk-client:<version>) standalone
If you are using the Hub/Node(s) mode or the Distributed mode, setting the -Dwebdriver.http.factory=jdk-http-client and --ext flags needs to be done for each one of the components.

Grid sizes
Choosing a Grid role depends on what operating systems and browsers need to be supported, how many parallel sessions need to be executed, the amount of available machines, and how powerful (CPU, RAM) those machines are.

Creating sessions concurrently relies on the available processors to the Distributor. For example, if a machine has 4 CPUs, the Distributor will only be able to create up to 4 sessions concurrently.

By default, the maximum amount of concurrent sessions a Node supports is limited by the number of CPUs available. For example, if the Node machine has 8CPUs, it can run up to 8 concurrent browser sessions (with the exception of Safari, which is always one). Additionally, it is expected that each browser session should use around 1GB RAM.

In general, it is a recommended to have Nodes as small as possible. Instead of having a machine with 32CPUs and 32GB RAM to run 32 concurrent browser sessions, it is better to have 32 small Nodes in order to better isolate processes. With this, if a Node fails, it will do it in an isolated way. Docker is a good tool to achieve this approach.

Note that the default values (1CPU/1GB RAM per browser) are a recommendation and they could not apply to your context. It is recommended to use them as a reference, but measuring performance continuously will help to determine the ideal values for your environment.

Grid sizes are relative to the amount of supported concurrent sessions and amount of Nodes, and there is no “one size fits all”. Sizes mentioned below are rough estimations thay can vary between different environments. For example a Hub/Node with 120 Nodes might work well when the Hub has enough resources. Values below are not set on stone, and feedback is welcomed!

Small
Standalone or Hub/Node with 5 or less Nodes.

Middle
Hub/Node between 6 and 60 Nodes.

Large
Hub/Node between 60 and 100 Nodes. Distributed with over 100 Nodes.

Warning
Selenium Grid must be protected from external access using appropriate firewall permissions.

Failure to protect your Grid could result in one or more of the following occurring:

You provide open access to your Grid infrastructure
You allow third parties to access internal web applications and files
You allow third parties to run custom binaries
See this blog post on Detectify, which gives a good overview of how a publicly exposed Grid could be misused: Don’t Leave your Grid Wide Open

Selenium Manager
v4.0
Selenium Manager (Beta)
Selenium Manager is a command-line tool implemented in Rust that provides automated driver and browser management for Selenium. Selenium bindings use this tool by default, so you do not need to download it or add anything to your code or do anything else to use it.
Motivation
TL;DR: Selenium Manager is the official driver manager of the Selenium project, and it is shipped out of the box with every Selenium release.

Selenium uses the native support implemented by each browser to carry out the automation process. For this reason, Selenium users need to place a component called driver (chromedriver, geckodriver, msedgedriver, etc.) between the script using the Selenium API and the browser. For many years, managing these drivers was a manual process for Selenium users. This way, they had to download the required driver for a browser (chromedriver for Chrome, geckodriver for Firefox, etc.) and place it in the PATH or export the driver path as a system property (Java, JavaScript, etc.). But this process was cumbersome and led to maintainability issues.

Let’s consider an example. Imagine you manually downloaded the required chromedriver for driving your Chrome with Selenium. When you did this process, the stable version of Chrome was 113, so you downloaded chromedriver 113 and put it in your PATH. At that moment, your Selenium script executed correctly. But the problem is that Chrome is evergreen. This name refers to Chrome’s ability to upgrade automatically and silently to the next stable version when available. This feature is excellent for end-users but potentially dangerous for browser automation. Let’s go back to the example to discover it. Your local Chrome eventually updates to version 115. And that moment, your Selenium script is broken due to the incompatibility between the manually downloaded driver (113) and the Chrome version (115). Thus, your Selenium script fails with the following error message: “session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 113”.

This problem is the primary reason for the existence of the so-called driver managers (such as WebDriverManager for Java, webdriver-manager for Python, webdriver-manager for JavaScript, WebDriverManager.Net for C#, and webdrivers for Ruby). All these projects were an inspiration and a clear sign that the community needed this feature to be built in Selenium. Thus, the Selenium project has created Selenium Manager, the official driver manager for Selenium, shipped out of the box with each Selenium release as of version 4.6.

Usage
TL;DR: Selenium Manager is used by the Selenium bindings when the drivers (chromedriver, geckodriver, etc.) are unavailable.

Driver management through Selenium Manager is opt-in for the Selenium bindings. Thus, users can continue managing their drivers manually (putting the driver in the PATH or using system properties) or rely on a third-party driver manager to do it automatically. Selenium Manager only operates as a fallback: if no driver is provided, Selenium Manager will come to the rescue.

Selenium Manager is a CLI (command line interface) tool implemented in Rust to allow cross-platform execution and compiled for Windows, Linux, and macOS. The Selenium Manager binaries are shipped with each Selenium release. This way, each Selenium binding language invokes Selenium Manager to carry out the automated driver and browser management explained in the following sections.

Automated driver management
TL;DR: Selenium Manager automatically discovers, downloads, and caches the drivers required by Selenium when these drivers are unavailable.

The primary feature of Selenium Manager is called automated driver management. Let’s consider an example to understand it. Suppose we want to driver Chrome with Selenium (see the doc about how to start a session with Selenium). Before the session begins, and when the driver is unavailable, Selenium Manager manages chromedriver for us. We use the term management for this feature (and not just download) since this process is broader and implies different steps:

Browser version discovery. Selenium Manager discovers the browser version (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) installed in the machine that executes Selenium. This step uses shell commands (e.g., google-chrome --version).
Driver version discovery. With the discovered browser version, the proper driver version is resolved. For this step, the online metadata/endpoints maintained by the browser vendors (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver, or msedgedriver) are used.
Driver download. The driver URL is obtained with the resolved driver version; with that URL, the driver artifact is downloaded, uncompressed, and stored locally.
Driver cache. Uncompressed driver binaries are stored in a local cache folder (~/.cache/selenium). The next time the same driver is required, it will be used from there if the driver is already in the cache.
Automated browser management
TL;DR: Selenium Manager automatically discovers, downloads, and caches the browsers driven with Selenium (Chrome, Firefox, and Edge) when these browsers are not installed in the local system.

As of Selenium 4.11.0, Selenium Manager also implements automated browser management. With this feature, Selenium Manager allows us to discover, download, and cache the different browser releases, making them seamlessly available for Selenium. Internally, Selenium Manager uses an equivalent management procedure explained in the section before, but this time, for browser releases.

The browser automatically managed by Selenium Manager are:

Chrome. Based on Chrome for Testing (CfT), as of Selenium 4.11.0.
Firefox. Based on public Firefox releases, as of Selenium 4.12.0.
Edge. Based on Edge downloads, as of Selenium 4.14.0.
Let’s consider again the typical example of driving Chrome with Selenium. And this time, suppose Chrome is not installed on the local machine when starting a new session). In that case, the current stable CfT release will be discovered, downloaded, and cached (in ~/.cache/selenium/chrome) by Selenium Manager.

But there is more. In addition to the stable browser version, Selenium Manager also allows downloading older browser versions (in the case of CfT, starting in version 113, the first version published as CfT). To set a browser version with Selenium, we use a browser option called browserVersion.

Let’s consider another simple example. Suppose we set browserVersion to 114 using Chrome options. In this case, Selenium Manager will check if Chrome 114 is already installed. If it is, it will be used. If not, Selenium Manager will manage (i.e., discover, download, and cache) CfT 114. And in either case, the chromedriver is also managed. Finally, Selenium will start Chrome to be driven programmatically, as usual.

But there is even more. In addition to fixed browser versions (e.g., 113, 114, 115, etc.), we can use the following labels for browserVersion:

stable: Current CfT version.
beta: Next version to stable.
dev: Version in development at this moment.
canary: Nightly build for developers.
esr: Extended Support Release (only for Firefox).
When these labels are specified, Selenium Manager first checks if a given browser is already installed (beta, dev, etc.), and when it is not detected, the browser is automatically managed.

Edge in Windows
Automated Edge management by Selenium Manager in Windows is different from other browsers. Both Chrome and Firefox (and Edge in macOS and Linux) are downloaded automatically to the local cache (~/.cache/selenium) by Selenium Manager. Nevertheless, the same cannot be done for Edge in Windows. The reason is that the Edge installer for Windows is distributed as a Microsoft Installer (MSI) file, designed to be executed with administrator rights. This way, when Edge is attempted to be installed with Selenium Manager in Windows with a non-administrator session, a warning message will be displayed by Selenium Manager as follows:

edge can only be installed in Windows with administrator permissions
Therefore, administrator permissions are required to install Edge in Windows automatically through Selenium Manager, and Edge is eventually installed in the usual program files folder (e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge).

Data collection
Selenium Manager will report anonymised usage statistics to Plausible. This allows the Selenium team to understand more about how Selenium is being used so that we can better focus our development efforts. The data being collected is:

Data	Purpose
Selenium version	This allows the Selenium developers to safely deprecate and remove features, as well as determine which new features may be available to you

Selenium Manager sends these data to Plausible once a day. This period is based on the TTL value (see configuration).

Opting out of data collection
Data collection is on by default. To disable it, set the SE_AVOID_STATS environment variable to true. You may also disable data collection in the configuration file (see below) by setting avoid-stats = true.

Configuration
TL;DR: Selenium Manager should work silently and transparently for most users. Nevertheless, there are scenarios (e.g., to specify a custom cache path or setup globally a proxy) where custom configuration can be required.

Selenium Manager is a CLI tool. Therefore, under the hood, the Selenium bindings call Selenium Manager by invoking shell commands. Like any other CLI tool, arguments can be used to specify specific capabilities in Selenium Manager. The different arguments supported by Selenium Manager can be checked by running the following command:

$ ./selenium-manager --help
In addition to CLI arguments, Selenium Manager allows two additional mechanisms for configuration:

Configuration file. Selenium Manager uses a file called se-config.toml located in the Selenium cache (by default, at ~/.cache/selenium) for custom configuration values. This TOML file contains a key-value collection used for custom configuration.
Environmental variables. Each configuration key has its equivalence in environmental variables by converting each key name to uppercase, replacing the dash symbol (-) with an underscore (_), and adding the prefix SE_.
The configuration file is honored by Selenium Manager when it is present, and the corresponding CLI parameter is not specified. Besides, the environmental variables are used when neither of the previous options (CLI arguments and configuration file) is specified. In other words, the order of preference for Selenium Manager custom configuration is as follows:

CLI arguments.
Configuration file.
Environment variables.
Notice that the Selenium bindings use the CLI arguments to specify configuration values, which in turn, are defined in each binding using browser options.

The following table summarizes all the supported arguments supported by Selenium Manager and their correspondence key in the configuration file and environment variables.

In addition to the configuration keys specified in the table before, there are some special cases, namely:

Browser version. In addition to browser-version, we can use the specific configuration keys to specify custom versions per supported browser. This way, the keys chrome-version, firefox-version, edge-version, etc., are supported. The same applies to environment variables (i.e., SE_CHROME_VERSION, SE_FIREFOX_VERSION, SE_EDGE_VERSION, etc.).
Driver version. Following the same pattern, we can use chromedriver-version, geckodriver-version, msedgedriver-version, etc. (in the configuration file), and SE_CHROMEDRIVER_VERSION, SE_GECKODRIVER_VERSION, SE_MSEDGEDRIVER_VERSION, etc. (as environment variables).
Browser path. Following the same pattern, we can use chrome-path, firefox-path, edge-path, etc. (in the configuration file), and SE_CHROME_PATH, SE_FIREFOX_PATH, SE_EDGE_PATH, etc. (as environment variables). The Selenium bindings also allow to specify a custom location of the browser path using options, namely: Chrome), Edge, or Firefox.
Driver mirror. Following the same pattern, we can use chromedriver-mirror-url, geckodriver-mirror-url, msedgedriver-mirror-url, etc. (in the configuration file), and SE_CHROMEDRIVER_MIRROR_URL, SE_GECKODRIVER_MIRROR_URL, SE_MSEDGEDRIVER_MIRROR_URL, etc. (as environment variables).
Browser mirror. Following the same pattern, we can use chrome-mirror-url, firefox-mirror-url, edge-mirror-url, etc. (in the configuration file), and SE_CHROME_MIRROR_URL, SE_FIREFOX_MIRROR_URL, SE_EDGE_MIRROR_URL, etc. (as environment variables).

Caching
TL;DR: The drivers and browsers managed by Selenium Manager are stored in a local folder (~/.cache/selenium).

The cache in Selenium Manager is a local folder (~/.cache/selenium by default) in which the downloaded assets (drivers and browsers) are stored. For the sake of performance, when a driver or browser is already in the cache (i.e., there is a cache hint), Selenium Manager uses it from there.

In addition to the downloaded drivers and browsers, two additional files live in the cache’s root:

Configuration file (se-config.toml). This file is optional and, as explained in the previous section, allows to store custom configuration values for Selenium Manager. This file is maintained by the end-user and read by Selenium Manager.
Metadata file (se-metadata.json). This file contains versions discovered by Selenium Manger making network requests (e.g., using the CfT JSON endpoints) and the time-to-live (TTL) in which they are valid. Selenium Manager automatically maintains this file.
The TTL in Selenium Manager is inspired by the TTL for DNS, a well-known mechanism that refers to how long some values are cached before they are automatically refreshed. In the case of Selenium Manager, these values are the versions found by making network requests for driver and browser version discovery. By default, the TTL is 3600 seconds (i.e., 1 hour) and can be tuned using configuration values or disabled by setting this configuration value to 0.

The TTL mechanism is a way to improve the overall performance of Selenium. It is based on the fact that the discovered driver and browser versions (e.g., the proper chromedriver version for Chrome 115 is 115.0.5790.170) will likely remain the same in the short term. Therefore, the discovered versions are written in the metadata file and read from there instead of making the same consecutive network request. This way, during the driver version discovery (step 2 of the automated driver management process previously introduced), Selenium Manager first reads the file metadata. When a fresh resolution (i.e., a driver/browser version valid during a TTL) is found, that version is used (saving some time in making a new network request). If not found or the TTL has expired, a network request is made, and the result is stored in the metadata file.

Let’s consider an example. A Selenium binding asks Selenium Manager to resolve chromedriver. Selenium Manager detects that Chrome 115 is installed, so it makes a network request to the CfT endpoints to discover the proper chromedriver version (115.0.5790.170, at that moment). This version is stored in the metadata file and considered valid during the next hour (TTL). If Selenium Manager is asked to resolve chromedriver during that time (which is likely to happen in the execution of a test suite), the chromedriver version is discovered by reading the metadata file instead of making a new request to the CfT endpoints. After one hour, the chromedriver version stored in the cache will be considered as stale, and Selenium Manager will refresh it by making a new network request to the corresponding endpoint.

Selenium Manager includes two additional arguments two handle the cache, namely:

--clear-cache: To remove the cache folder (equivalent to the environment variable SE_CLEAR_CACHE=true).
--clear-metadata: To remove the metadata file (equivalent to the environment variable SE_CLEAR_METADATA=true).
Versioning
Selenium Manager follows the same versioning schema as Selenium. Nevertheless, we use the major version 0 for Selenium Manager releases because it is still in beta. For example, the Selenium Manager binaries shipped with Selenium 4.12.0 corresponds to version 0.4.12.

Getting Selenium Manager
For most users, direct interaction with Selenium Manager is not required since the Selenium bindings use it internally. Nevertheless, if you want to play with Selenium Manager or use it for your use case involving driver or browser management, you can get the Selenium Manager binaries in different ways:

From the Selenium repository. The Selenium Manager source code is stored in the main Selenium repo under the folder rust. Moreover, you can find the compiled versions for Windows, Linux, and macOS in the Selenium Manager Artifacts repo. The stable Selenium Manager binaries (i.e., those distributed in the latest stable Selenium version) are linked in this file.
From the build workflow. Selenium Manager is compiled using a GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow creates binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS. You can download these binaries from these workflow executions.
From the cache. As of version 4.15.0 of the Selenium Java bindings, the Selenium Manager binary is extracted and copied to the cache folder. For instance, the Selenium Manager binary shipped with Selenium 4.15.0 is stored in the folder ~/.cache/selenium/manager/0.4.15).
Examples
Let’s consider a typical example: we want to manage chromedriver automatically. For that, we invoke Selenium Manager as follows (notice that the flag --debug is optional, but it helps us to understand what Selenium Manager is doing):

$ ./selenium-manager --browser chrome --debug
DEBUG   chromedriver not found in PATH
DEBUG   chrome detected at C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
DEBUG   Running command: wmic datafile where name='C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe' get Version /value
DEBUG   Output: "\r\r\n\r\r\nVersion=116.0.5845.111\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r"
DEBUG   Detected browser: chrome 116.0.5845.111
DEBUG   Discovering versions from https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/known-good-versions-with-downloads.json
DEBUG   Required driver: chromedriver 116.0.5845.96
DEBUG   Downloading chromedriver 116.0.5845.96 from https://edgedl.me.gvt1.com/edgedl/chrome/chrome-for-testing/116.0.5845.96/win64/chromedriver-win64.zip
INFO    Driver path: C:\Users\boni\.cache\selenium\chromedriver\win64\116.0.5845.96\chromedriver.exe
INFO    Browser path: C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
In this case, the local Chrome (in Windows) is detected by Selenium Manager. Then, using its version and the CfT endpoints, the proper chromedriver version (115, in this example) is downloaded to the local cache. Finally, Selenium Manager provides two results: i) the driver path (downloaded) and ii) the browser path (local).

Let’s consider another example. Now we want to use Chrome beta. Therefore, we invoke Selenium Manager specifying that version label as follows (notice that the CfT beta is discovered, downloaded, and stored in the local cache):

$ ./selenium-manager --browser chrome --browser-version beta --debug
DEBUG   chromedriver not found in PATH
DEBUG   chrome not found in PATH
DEBUG   chrome beta not found in the system
DEBUG   Discovering versions from https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/last-known-good-versions-with-downloads.json

Selenium Grid
Selenium Manager allows you to configure the drivers automatically when setting up Selenium Grid. To that aim, you need to include the argument --selenium-manager true in the command to start Selenium Grid. For more details, visit the Selenium Grid starting page.

Moreover, Selenium Manager also allows managing Selenium Grid releases automatically. For that, the argument --grid is used as follows:

$ ./selenium-manager --grid
After this command, Selenium Manager discovers the latest version of Selenium Grid, storing the selenium-server.jar in the local cache.

Optionally, the argument --grid allows to specify a Selenium Grid version (--grid <GRID_VERSION>).

Known Limitations
Connectivity issues
Selenium Manager requests remote endpoints (like Chrome for Testing (CfT), among others) to discover and download drivers and browsers from online repositories. When this operation is done in a corporate environment with a proxy or firewall, it might lead to connectivity problems like the following:

error sending request for url (https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/known-good-versions-with-downloads.json)
error trying to connect: dns error: failed to lookup address information
error trying to connect: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host. (os error 10054)
When that happens, consider the following solutions:

Use the proxy capabilities of Selenium (see documentation). Alternatively, use the environment variable SE_PROXY to set the proxy URL or use the configuration file (see configuration).
Review your network setup to enable the remote requests and downloads required by Selenium Manager.
Custom package managers
If you are using a Linux package manager (Anaconda, snap, etc) that requires a specific driver be used for your browsers, you’ll need to either specify the driver location, the browser location, or both, depending on the requirements.

Alternative architectures
Selenium supports all five architectures managed by Google’s Chrome for Testing, and all six drivers provided for Microsoft Edge.

Each release of the Selenium bindings comes with three separate Selenium Manager binaries — one for Linux, Windows, and Mac.

The Mac version supports both x64 and aarch64 (Intel and Apple).
The Windows version should work for both x86 and x64 (32-bit and 64-bit OS).
The Linux version has only been verified to work for x64.
Reasons for not supporting more architectures:

Neither Chrome for Testing nor Microsoft Edge supports additional architectures, so Selenium Manager would need to manage something unofficial for it to work.
We currently build the binaries from existing GitHub actions runners, which do not support these architectures
Any additional architectures would get distributed with all Selenium releases, increasing the total build size
If you are running Linux on arm64/aarch64, 32-bit architecture, or a Raspberry Pi, Selenium Manager will not work for you. The biggest issue for people is that they used to get custom-built drivers and put them on PATH and have them work. Now that Selenium Manager is responsible for locating drivers on PATH, this approach no longer works, and users need to use a Service class and set the location directly. There are a number of advantages to having Selenium Manager look for drivers on PATH instead of managing that logic in each of the bindings, so that’s currently a trade-off we are comfortable with.

However, as of Selenium 4.13.0, the Selenium bindings allow locating the Selenium Manager binary using an environment variable called SE_MANAGER_PATH. If this variable is set, the bindings will use its value as the Selenium Manager path in the local filesystem. This feature will allow users to provide a custom compilation of Selenium Manager, for instance, if the default binaries (compiled for Windows, Linux, and macOS) are incompatible with a given system (e.g., ARM64 in Linux).

Browser dependencies
When automatically managing browsers in Linux, Selenium Manager relies on the releases published by the browser vendors (i.e., Chrome, Firefox, and Edge). These releases are portable in most cases. Nevertheless, there might be cases in which existing libraries are required. In Linux, this problem might be experienced when trying to run Firefox, e.g., as follows:

libdbus-glib-1.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Couldn't load XPCOM.
If that happens, the solution is to install that library, for instance, as follows:

sudo apt-get install libdbus-glib-1-2
A similar issue might happen when trying to execute Chrome for Testing in Linux:

error while loading shared libraries: libatk-1.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
In this case, the library to be installed is the following:

sudo apt-get install libatk-bridge2.0-0
Using an environment variable for the driver path
It’s possible to use an environment variable to specify the driver path without using Selenium Manager. The following environment variables are supported:

SE_CHROMEDRIVER
SE_EDGEDRIVER
SE_GECKODRIVER
SE_IEDRIVER
SE_SAFARIDRIVER
For example, to specify the path to the chromedriver, you can set the SE_CHROMEDRIVER environment variable to the path of the chromedriver executable. The following bindings allow you to specify the driver path using an environment variable:

Ruby
Java
Python
This feature is available in the Selenium Ruby binding starting from version 4.25.0 and in the Python binding from version 4.26.0.

Building a Custom Selenium Manager
In order to build your own custom Selenium Manager that works in an architecture we don’t currently support, you can utilize the following steps:

Install Rust Dev Environment
clone Selenium onto your local machine git clone https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium.git --depth 1
Navigate into your clone cd selenium/rust
Build selenium cargo build --release
Set the following environment variable for the driver path SE_MANAGER_PATH=~/selenium/rust/target/release/selenium-manager
Put the driver you want in a location on your system PATH
Selenium will now use the built Selenium Manager to locate the manually downloaded driver on PATH
Roadmap
You can trace the work in progress in the Selenium Manager project dashboard. Moreover, you can check the new features shipped with each Selenium Manager release in its changelog file.

Use the PATH environment variable
This option first requires manually downloading the driver.

This is a flexible option to change location of drivers without having to update your code, and will work on multiple machines without requiring that each machine put the drivers in the same place.

You can either place the drivers in a directory that is already listed in PATH, or you can place them in a directory and add it to PATH.

Bash
Zsh
Windows
To see what directories are already on PATH, open a Terminal and execute:

echo $PATH
If the location to your driver is not already in a directory listed, you can add a new directory to PATH:

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/driver' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
You can test if it has been added correctly by checking the version of the driver:

chromedriver --version
Specify the location of the driver
If you cannot upgrade to the latest version of Selenium, you do not want Selenium to download drivers for you, and you can’t figure out the environment variables, you can specify the location of the driver in the Service object.

You first need to download the desired driver, then create an instance of the applicable Service class and set the path.

Specifying the location in the code itself has the advantage of not needing to figure out Environment Variables on your system, but has the drawback of making the code less flexible.

Driver management libraries
Before Selenium managed drivers itself, other projects were created to do so for you.

If you can’t use Selenium Manager because you are using an older version of Selenium (please upgrade), or need an advanced feature not yet implemented by Selenium Manager, you might try one of these tools to keep your drivers automatically updated:

WebDriverManager (Java)
WebDriver Manager (Python)
WebDriver Manager Package (.NET)
webdrivers gem (Ruby)

Grid
When to Use Grid
v4.0
When to Use Grid
Is Grid right for you?
When would you use a Selenium Grid?

To run your tests in parallel, against different browser types, browser versions, operating systems
To reduce the time needed to execute a test suite
Selenium Grid runs test suites in parallel against multiple machines (called Nodes). For large and long-running test suites, this can save minutes, hours, or perhaps days. This shortens the turnaround time for test results as your application under test (AUT) changes.

Grid can run tests (in parallel) against multiple different browsers, and it can run against multiple instances of the same browser. As an example, let’s imagine a Grid with six Nodes. The first machine has Firefox’s latest version, the second has Firefox “latest minus one”, the third gets the latest Chrome, and the remaining three machines are Mac Minis, which allows for three tests to run in parallel on the latest version of Safari.

Execution time can be expressed as a simple formula:

Number of Tests * Average Test Time / Number of Nodes = Total Execution Time

   15      *       45s        /        1        =      11m 15s   // Without Grid
   15      *       45s        /        5        =      2m 15s    // Grid with 5 Nodes
   15      *       45s        /        15       =      45s       // Grid with 15 Nodes
  100      *       120s       /        15       =      13m 20s   // Would take over 3 hours without Grid
As the test suite is executing, the Grid allocates the tests to run against these browsers as configured in the tests.

A configuration such as this can greatly speed up the execution time of even the largest Selenium test suites.

Selenium Grid is a completely native part of the Selenium project, and is maintained in parallel by the same team of committers who work in the core Selenium development. Recognizing the importance of test execution speed, Grid has been a critical part of the Selenium project since the earliest days.

Selenium Grid Components
Understand how to use the different Grid components
Selenium Grid 4 is a ground-up rewrite from previous versions. In addition to a comprehensive set of improvements to performance and standards compliance, the different functions of the grid were broken out to reflect a more modern age of computing and software development. Purpose-build for containerization and cloud-distributed scalability, Selenium Grid 4 is a wholly new solution for the modern era.

Selenium Grid 4 Components

Router
The Router is the entry point of the Grid, receiving all external requests, and forwards them to the correct component.

If the Router receives a new session request, it will be forwarded to the New Session Queue.

If the request belongs to an existing session, the Router will query the Session Map to get the Node ID where the session is running, and then the request will be forwarded directly to the Node.

The Router balances the load in the Grid by sending the requests to the component that is able to handle them better, without overloading any component that is not needed in the process.

Distributor
The Distributor has two main responsibilities:

Register and keep track of all Nodes and their capabilities
A Node registers to the Distributor by sending a Node registration event through the Event Bus. The Distributor reads it, and then tries to reach the Node via HTTP to confirm its existence. If the request is successful, the Distributor registers the Node and keeps track of all Nodes capabilities through the GridModel.

Query the New Session Queue and process any pending new session requests
When a new session request is sent to the Router, it gets forwarded to the New Session Queue, where it will wait in the queue. The Distributor will poll the New Session Queue for pending new session requests, and then finds a suitable Node where the session can be created. After the session has been created, the Distributor stores in the Session Map the relation between the session id and Node where the session is being executed.

Session Map
The Session Map is a data store that keeps the relationship between the session id and the Node where the session is running. It supports the Router in the process of forwarding a request to the Node. The Router will ask the Session Map for the Node associated to a session id.

New Session Queue
The New Session Queue holds all the new session requests in a FIFO order. It has configurable parameters for setting the request timeout and request retry interval (how often the timeout will be checked).

The Router adds the new session request to the New Session Queue and waits for the response. The New Session Queue regularly checks if any request in the queue has timed out, if so the request is rejected and removed immediately.

The Distributor regularly checks if a slot is available. If so, the Distributor polls the New Session Queue for the first matching request. The Distributor then attempts to create a new session.

Once the requested capabilities match the capabilities of any of the free Node slots, the Distributor attempts to get the available slot. If all the slots are busy, the Distributor will send the request back to the queue. If request times out while retrying or adding to the front of the queue, it will be rejected.

After a session is created successfully, the Distributor sends the session information to the New Session Queue, which then gets sent back to the Router, and finally to the client.

Node
A Grid can contain multiple Nodes. Each Node manages the slots for the available browsers of the machine where it is running.

The Node registers itself to the Distributor through the Event Bus, and its configuration is sent as part of the registration message.

By default, the Node auto-registers all browser drivers available on the path of the machine where it runs. It also creates one slot per available CPU for Chromium based browsers and Firefox. For Safari, only one slot is created. Through a specific configuration, it can run sessions in Docker containers or relay commands.

A Node only executes the received commands, it does not evaluate, make judgments, or control anything other than the flow of commands and responses. The machines where the Node is running does not need to have the same operating system as the other components. For example, A Windows Node might have the capability of offering IE Mode on Edge as a browser option, whereas this would not be possible on Linux or Mac, and a Grid can have multiple Nodes configured with Windows, Mac, or Linux.

Event Bus
The Event Bus serves as a communication path between the Nodes, Distributor, New Session Queue, and Session Map. The Grid does most of its internal communication through messages, avoiding expensive HTTP calls. When starting the Grid in its fully distributed mode, the Event Bus is the first component that should be started.

--distributor-host	string	localhost	Host on which the distributor is listening.
--distributor-implementation	string	org.openqa.selenium.grid.distributor.local.LocalDistributor	Full class name of non-default distributor implementation
--distributor-port	int	5553	Port on which the distributor is listening.
--reject-unsupported-caps	boolean	false	Allow the Distributor to reject a request immediately if the Grid does not support the requested capability. Rejecting requests immediately is suitable for a Grid setup that does not spin up Nodes on demand.
--slot-matcher	string	org.openqa.selenium.grid.data.DefaultSlotMatcher	Full class name of non-default slot matcher to use. This is used to determine whether a Node can support a particular session.

Configuration examples
All the options mentioned above can be used when starting the Grid components. They are a good way of exploring the Grid options, and trying out values to find a suitable configuration.

We recommend the use of Toml files to configure a Grid. Configuration files improve readability, and you can also check them in source control.

When needed, you can combine a Toml file configuration with CLI arguments.

Command-line flags
To pass config options as command-line flags, identify the valid options for the component and follow the template below.

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar <component> --<option> value
Standalone, setting max sessions and main port
java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar standalone --max-sessions 4 --port 4444
Hub, setting a new session request timeout, a main port, and disabling tracing
java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar hub --session-request-timeout 500 --port 3333 --tracing false
Node, with 4 max sessions, with debug(fine) log, 7777 as port, and only with Firefox and Edge
java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --max-sessions 4 --log-level "fine" --port 7777 --driver-implementation "firefox" --driver-implementation "edge"
Distributor, setting Session Map server url, Session Queue server url, and disabling bus
java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar distributor --sessions http://localhost:5556 --sessionqueue http://localhost:5559 --bind-bus false
Setting custom capabilities for matching specific Nodes
Important: Custom capabilities need to be set in the configuration in all Nodes. They also need to be included always in every session request.

Start the Hub
java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar hub
Start the Node A with custom cap set to true
java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --detect-drivers false --driver-configuration display-name="Chrome (custom capability true)" max-sessions=1 stereotype='{"browserName":"chrome","gsg:customcap":true}' --port 6161
Start the Node B with custom cap set to false
java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --detect-drivers false --driver-configuration display-name="Chrome (custom capability true)" max-sessions=1 stereotype='{"browserName":"chrome","gsg:customcap":false}' --port 6262
Matching Node A
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.setCapability("gsg:customcap", true);
WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://localhost:4444"), options);
driver.get("https://selenium.dev");
driver.quit();
Set the custom capability to false in order to match the Node B.

Enabling Managed downloads by the Node
At times a test may need to access files that were downloaded by it on the Node. To retrieve such files, following can be done.

Start the Hub
java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar hub
Start the Node with manage downloads enabled
java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --enable-managed-downloads true
Set the capability at the test level
Tests that want to use this feature should set the capability "se:downloadsEnabled"to true

options.setCapability("se:downloadsEnabled", true);
How does this work
The Grid infrastructure will try to match a session request with "se:downloadsEnabled" against ONLY those nodes which were started with --enable-managed-downloads true
If a session is matched, then the Node automatically sets the required capabilities to let the browser know, as to where should a file be downloaded.
The Node now allows a user to:
List all the files that were downloaded for a specific session and
Retrieve a specific file from the list of files.
The directory into which files were downloaded for a specific session gets automatically cleaned up when the session ends (or) timesout due to inactivity.
Note: Currently this capability is ONLY supported on:

Edge
Firefox and
Chrome browser
Listing files that can be downloaded for current session:
The endpoint to GET from is /session/<sessionId>/se/files.
The session needs to be active in order for the command to work.
The raw response looks like below:
{
  "value": {
    "names": [
      "Red-blue-green-channel.jpg"
    ]
  }
}
In the response the list of file names appear under the key names.

Dowloading a file:
The endpoint to POST from is /session/<sessionId>/se/files with a payload of the form {"name": "fileNameGoesHere}
The session needs to be active in order for the command to work.
The raw response looks like below:
{
	"value": {
		"filename": "Red-blue-green-channel.jpg",
		"contents": "Base64EncodedStringContentsOfDownloadedFileAsZipGoesHere"
	}
}
The response blob contains two keys,
filename - The file name that was downloaded.
contents - Base64 encoded zipped contents of the file.
The file contents are Base64 encoded and they need to be unzipped.
List files that can be downloaded
The below mentioned curl example can be used to list all the files that were downloaded by the current session in the Node, and which can be retrieved locally.

curl -X GET "http://localhost:4444/session/90c0149a-2e75-424d-857a-e78734943d4c/se/files"
A sample response would look like below:

{
  "value": {
    "names": [
      "Red-blue-green-channel.jpg"
    ]
  }
}
Retrieve a downloaded file
Assuming the downloaded file is named Red-blue-green-channel.jpg, and using curl, the file could be downloaded with the following command:

curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
-X POST -d '{"name":"Red-blue-green-channel.jpg"}' \
"http://localhost:4444/session/18033434-fa4f-4d11-a7df-9e6d75920e19/se/files"
A sample response would look like below:

{
  "value": {
    "filename": "Red-blue-green-channel.jpg",
    "contents": "UEsDBBQACAgIAJpagVYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaAAAAUmVkLWJsAAAAAAAAAAAAUmVkLWJsdWUtZ3JlZW4tY2hhbm5lbC5qcGdQSwUGAAAAAAEAAQBIAAAAcNkAAAAA"
  }
}

Grid configuration examples using Toml files.
All the options shown in CLI options can be configured through a TOML file. This page shows configuration examples for the different Grid components.

Note that this documentation could be outdated if an option was modified or added but has not been documented yet. In case you bump into this situation, please check the “Config help” section and feel free to send us a pull request updating this page.

Overview
Selenium Grid uses TOML format for config files. The config file consists of sections and each section has options and its respective value(s).

Refer to the TOML documentation for detailed usage guidance. In case of parsing errors, validate the config using TOML linter.

The general configuration structure has the following pattern:

[section1]
option1="value"

[section2]
option2=["value1","value2"]
option3=true
Below are some examples of Grid components configured with a Toml file, the component can be started in the following way:

java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar <component> --config /path/to/file/<file-name>.toml
Standalone
A Standalone server, running on port 4449, and a new session request timeout of 500 seconds.

[server]
port = 4449

[sessionqueue]
session-request-timeout = 500
Specific browsers and a limit of max sessions
A Standalone server or a Node which only has Firefox and Chrome enabled by default.

[node]
drivers = ["chrome", "firefox"]
max-sessions = 3
Configuring and customising drivers
Standalone or Node server with customised drivers, which allows things like having Firefox Beta or Nightly, and having different browser versions.

[node]
detect-drivers = false
[[node.driver-configuration]]
max-sessions = 100
display-name = "Firefox Nightly"
stereotype = "{\"browserName\": \"firefox\", \"browserVersion\": \"93\", \"platformName\": \"MAC\", \"moz:firefoxOptions\": {\"binary\": \"/Applications/Firefox Nightly.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin\"}}"
[[node.driver-configuration]]
display-name = "Chrome Beta"
stereotype = "{\"browserName\": \"chrome\", \"browserVersion\": \"94\", \"platformName\": \"MAC\", \"goog:chromeOptions\": {\"binary\": \"/Applications/Google Chrome Beta.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome Beta\"}}"
[[node.driver-configuration]]
display-name = "Chrome Dev"
stereotype = "{\"browserName\": \"chrome\", \"browserVersion\": \"95\", \"platformName\": \"MAC\", \"goog:chromeOptions\": {\"binary\": \"/Applications/Google Chrome Dev.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome Dev\"}}"
webdriver-executable = '/path/to/chromedriver/95/chromedriver'
Standalone or Node with Docker
A Standalone or Node server that is able to run each new session in a Docker container. Disabling drivers detection, having maximum 2 concurrent sessions. Stereotypes configured need to be mapped to a Docker image, and the Docker daemon needs to be exposed via http/tcp. In addition, it is possible to define which device files, accessible on the host, will be available in containers through the devices property. Refer to the docker documentation for more information about how docker device mapping works.

[node]
detect-drivers = false
max-sessions = 2

[docker]
configs = [
    "selenium/standalone-chrome:93.0", "{\"browserName\": \"chrome\", \"browserVersion\": \"91\"}", 
    "selenium/standalone-firefox:92.0", "{\"browserName\": \"firefox\", \"browserVersion\": \"92\"}"
]
#Optionally define all device files that should be mapped to docker containers
#devices = [
#    "/dev/kvm:/dev/kvm"
#]
url = "http://localhost:2375"
video-image = "selenium/video:latest"
Relaying commands to a service endpoint that supports WebDriver
It is useful to connect an external service that supports WebDriver to Selenium Grid. An example of such service could be a cloud provider or an Appium server. In this way, Grid can enable more coverage to platforms and versions not present locally.

The following is an en example of connecting an Appium server to Grid.

[node]
detect-drivers = false

[relay]
# Default Appium/Cloud server endpoint
url = "http://localhost:4723/wd/hub"
status-endpoint = "/status"
# Optional, enforce a specific protocol version in HttpClient when communicating with the endpoint service status (e.g. HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2)
protocol-version = "HTTP/1.1"
# Stereotypes supported by the service. The initial number is "max-sessions", and will allocate 
# that many test slots to that particular configuration
configs = [
  "5", "{\"browserName\": \"chrome\", \"platformName\": \"android\", \"appium:platformVersion\": \"11\"}"
]
Basic auth enabled
It is possible to protect a Grid with basic auth by configuring the Router/Hub/Standalone with a username and password. This user/password combination will be needed when loading the Grid UI or starting a new session.

[router]
username = "admin"
password = "myStrongPassword"
Here is a Java example showing how to start a session using the configured user and password.

ClientConfig clientConfig = ClientConfig.defaultConfig()
  .baseUrl(new URL("http://localhost:4444"))
  .authenticateAs(new UsernameAndPassword("admin", "myStrongPassword"));
HttpCommandExecutor executor = new HttpCommandExecutor(clientConfig);
RemoteWebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(executor, new ChromeOptions());
In other languages, you can use the URL http://admin:myStrongPassword@localhost:4444

Setting custom capabilities for matching specific Nodes
Important: Custom capabilities need to be set in the configuration in all Nodes. They also need to be included always in every session request.

[node]
detect-drivers = false

[[node.driver-configuration]]
display-name = "firefox"
stereotype = '{"browserName": "firefox", "platformName": "macOS", "browserVersion":"96", "networkname:applicationName":"node_1", "nodename:applicationName":"app_1" }'
max-sessions = 5
Here is a Java example showing how to match that Node

FirefoxOptions options = new FirefoxOptions();
options.setCapability("networkname:applicationName", "node_1");
options.setCapability("nodename:applicationName", "app_1");
options.setBrowserVersion("96");
options.setPlatformName("macOS");
WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://localhost:4444"), options);
driver.get("https://selenium.dev");
driver.quit();
Enabling Managed downloads by the Node.
The Node can be instructed to manage downloads automatically. This will cause the Node to save all files that were downloaded for a particular session into a temp directory, which can later be retrieved from the node. To turn this capability on, use the below configuration:

[node]
enable-managed-downloads = true
Refer to the CLI section for a complete example.

Last modified April 23, 2024: [grid] update list CLI/TOML options (#16

Grid architecture
The Grid is designed as a set of components that all fulfill a role in maintaining the Grid. It can seem quite complicated, but hopefully this document can help clear up any confusion.

The Key Components
The main components of the Grid are:

Event Bus
Used for sending messages which may be received asynchronously between the other components.
New Session Queue
Maintains a list of incoming sessions which have yet to be assigned to a Node by the Distributor.
Distributor
Responsible for maintaining a model of the available locations in the Grid where a session may run (known as "slots") and taking any incoming new session requests and assigning them to a slot.
Node
Runs a WebDriver session. Each session is assigned to a slot, and each node has one or more slots.
Session Map
Maintains a mapping between the session ID and the address of the Node the session is running on.
Router
Acts as the front-end of the Grid. This is the only part of the Grid which may be exposed to the wider Web (though we strongly caution against it). This routes incoming requests to either the New Session Queue or the Node on which the session is running.
While discussing the Grid, there are some other useful concepts to keep in mind:

A slot is the place where a session can run.
Each slot has a stereotype. This is the minimal set of capabilities that a new session session request must match before the Distributor will send that request to the Node owning the slot.
The Grid Model is how the Distributor tracks the state of the Grid. As the name suggests, this may sometimes fall out of sync with reality (perhaps because the Distributor has only just started). It is used in preference to querying each Node so that the Distributor can quickly assign a slot to a New Session request.
Synchronous and Asynchronous Calls
There are two main communication mechanisms used within the Grid:

Synchronous “REST-ish” JSON over HTTP requests.
Asynchronous events sent to the Event Bus.
How do we pick which communication mechanism to use? After all, we could model the entire Grid in an event-based way, and it would work out just fine.

The answer is that if the action being performed is synchronous (eg. most WebDriver calls), or if missing the response would be problematic, the Grid uses a synchronous call. If, instead, we want to broadcast information to anyone who’s interested, or if missing the response doesn’t matter, then we prefer to use the event bus.

One interesting thing to note is that the async calls are more decoupled from their listeners than the synchronous calls are.

Start Up Sequence and Dependencies Between Components
Although the Grid is designed to allow components to start up in any order, conceptually the order in which components starts is:

The Event Bus and Session Map start first. These have no other dependencies, not even on each other, and so are safe to start in parallel.
The Session Queue starts next.
It is now possible to start the Distributor. This will periodically connect to the Session Queue and poll for jobs, though this polling might be initiated either by an event (that a New Session has been added to the queue) or at regular intervals.
The Router(s) can be started. New Session requests will be directed to the Session Queue, and the Distributor will attempt to find a slot to run the session on.
We are now able to start a Node. See below for details about how the Node is registered with the Grid. Once registration is complete, the Grid is ready to serve traffic.
You can picture the dependencies between components this way, where a “✅” indicates that there is a synchronous dependency between the components.

Event Bus	Distributor	Node	Router	Session Map	Session Queue
Event Bus	X					
Distributor	✅	X	✅			✅
Node	✅		X			
Router			✅	X	✅	
Session Map					X	
Session Queue	✅					X
Node Registration
The process of registering a new Node to the Grid is lightweight.

When the Node starts, it should emit a “heart beat” event on a regular basis. This heartbeat contains the node status.
The Distributor listens for the heart beat events. When it sees one, it attempts to GET the /status endpoint of the Node. It is from this information that the Grid is set up.
The Distributor will use the same /status endpoint to check the Node on a regular basis, but the Node should continue sending heart beat events even after started so that a Distributor without a persistent store of the Grid state can be restarted and will (eventually) be up to date and correct.

The Node Status Object
The Node Status is a JSON blob with the following fields:

Name	Type	Description
availability	string	A string which is one of up, draining, or down. The important one is draining, which indicates that no new sessions should be sent to the Node, and once the last session on it closes, the Node will exit or restart.
externalUrl	string	The URI that the other components in the Grid should connect to.
lastSessionCreated	integer	The epoch timestamp of when the last session was created on this Node. The Distributor will attempt to send new sessions to the Node that has been idle longest if all other things are equal.
maxSessionCount	integer	Although a session count can be inferred by counting the number of available slots, this integer value is used to determine the maximum number of sessions that should be running simultaneously on the Node before it is considered “full”.
nodeId	string	A UUID used to identify this instance of the Node.
osInfo	object	An object with arch, name, and version fields. This is used by the Grid UI and the GraphQL queries.
slots	array	An array of Slot objects (described below)
version	string	The version of the Node (for Selenium, this will match the Selenium version number)
It is recommended to put values in all fields.

The Slot Object
The Slot object represents a single slot within a Node. A “slot” is where a single session may be run. It is possible that a Node will have more slots than it can run concurrently. For example, a node may be able to run up 10 sessions, but they could be any combination of Chrome, Edge, or Firefox; in this case, the Node would indicate a “max session count” of 10, and then also say it has 10 slots for Chrome, 10 for Edge, and 10 for Firefox.

Name	Type	Description
id	string	UUID to refer to the slot
lastStarted	string	When the slot last had a session started, in ISO-8601 format
stereotype	object	The minimal set of capabilities this slot will match against. A minimal example is {"browserName": "firefox"}
session	object	The Session object (see below)
The Session Object
This represents a running session within a slot

Name	Type	Description
capabilities	object	The actual capabilities provided by the session. Will match the return value from the new session command
startTime	string	The start time of the session in ISO-8601 format
stereotype	object	The minimal set of capabilities this slot will match against. A minimal example is {"browserName": "firefox"}
uri	string	The URI used by the Node to communicate with the ses

Selenium Grid
Grid aids in scaling and distributing tests by executing tests on various browser and operating system combinations.

Observability
Observability has three pillars: traces, metrics and logs. Since Selenium Grid 4 is designed to be fully distributed, observability will make it easier to understand and debug the internals.

Distributed tracing
A single request or transaction spans multiple services and components. Tracing tracks the request lifecycle as each service executes the request. It is useful in debugging in an error scenario. Some key terms used in tracing context are:

Trace Tracing allows one to trace a request through multiple services, starting from its origin to its final destination. This request’s journey helps in debugging, monitoring the end-to-end flow, and identifying failures. A trace depicts the end-to-end request flow. Each trace has a unique id as its identifier.

Span Each trace is made up of timed operations called spans. A span has a start and end time and it represents operations done by a service. The granularity of span depends on how it is instrumented. Each span has a unique identifier. All spans within a trace have the same trace id.

Span Attributes Span attributes are key-value pairs which provide additional information about each span.

Events Events are timed-stamped logs within a span. They provide additional context to the existing spans. Events also contain key-value pairs as event attributes.

Event logging
Logging is essential to debug an application. Logging is often done in a human-readable format. But for machines to search and analyze the logs, it has to have a well-defined format. Structured logging is a common practice of recording logs consistently in a fixed format. It commonly contains fields like:

Timestamp
Logging level
Logger class
Log message (This is further broken down into fields relevant to the operation where the log was recorded)
Logs and events are closely related. Events encapsulate all the possible information available to do a single unit of work. Logs are essentially subsets of an event. At the crux, both aid in debugging. Refer following resources for detailed understanding:

https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/how-are-structured-logs-different-from-events/
https://charity.wtf/2019/02/05/logs-vs-structured-events/
Grid Observability
Selenium server is instrumented with tracing using OpenTelemetry. Every request to the server is traced from start to end. Each trace consists of a series of spans as a request is executed within the server. Most spans in the Selenium server consist of two events:

Normal event - records all information about a unit of work and marks successful completion of the work.
Error event - records all information till the error occurs and then records the error information. Marks an exception event.
Running Selenium server

Standalone
Hub and Node
Fully Distributed
Docker
Visualizing Traces
All spans, events and their respective attributes are part of a trace. Tracing works while running the server in all of the above-mentioned modes.

By default, tracing is enabled in the Selenium server. Selenium server exports the traces via two exporters:

Console - Logs all traces and their included spans at FINE level. By default, Selenium server prints logs at INFO level and above. The log-level flag can be used to pass a logging level of choice while running the Selenium Grid jar/s.
java -jar selenium-server-4.0.0-<selenium-version>.jar standalone --log-level FINE
Jaeger UI - OpenTelemetry provides the APIs and SDKs to instrument traces in the code. Whereas Jaeger is a tracing backend, that aids in collecting the tracing telemetry data and providing querying, filtering and visualizing features for the data.
Detailed instructions of visualizing traces using Jaeger UI can be obtained by running the command :

java -jar selenium-server-4.0.0-<selenium-version>.jar info tracing
A very good example and scripts to run the server and send traces to Jaeger

Leveraging event logs
Tracing has to be enabled for event logging as well, even if one does not wish to export traces to visualize them.
By default, tracing is enabled. No additional parameters need to be passed to see logs on the console. All events within a span are logged at FINE level. Error events are logged at WARN level.

All event logs have the following fields :

Field	Field value	Description
Event time	eventId	Timestamp of the event record in epoch nanoseconds.
Trace Id	tracedId	Each trace is uniquely identified by a trace id.
Span Id	spanId	Each span within a trace is uniquely identified by a span id.
Span Kind	spanKind	Span kind is a property of span indicating the type of span. It helps in understanding the nature of the unit of work done by the Span.
Event name	eventName	This maps to the log message.
Event attributes	eventAttributes	This forms the crux of the event logs, based on the operation executed, it has JSON formatted key-value pairs. This also includes a handler class attribute, to show the logger class.
Sample log

FINE [LoggingOptions$1.lambda$export$1] - {
  "traceId": "fc8aef1d44b3cc8bc09eb8e581c4a8eb",
  "spanId": "b7d3b9865d3ddd45",
  "spanKind": "INTERNAL",
  "eventTime": 1597819675128886121,
  "eventName": "Session request execution complete",
  "attributes": {
    "http.status_code": 200,
    "http.handler_class": "org.openqa.selenium.grid.router.HandleSession",
    "http.url": "\u002fsession\u002fdd35257f104bb43fdfb06242953f4c85",
    "http.method": "DELETE",
    "session.id": "dd35257f104bb43fdfb06242953f4c85"
  }
}
In addition to the above fields, based on OpenTelemetry specification error logs consist of :

Field	Field value	Description
Exception type	exception.type	The class name of the exception.
Exception message	exception.message	Reason for the exception.
Exception stacktrace	exception.stacktrace	Prints the call stack at the point of time when the exception was thrown. Helps in understanding the origin of the exception.
Sample error log

WARN [LoggingOptions$1.lambda$export$1] - {
  "traceId": "7efa5ea57e02f89cdf8de586fe09f564",
  "spanId": "914df6bc9a1f6e2b",
  "spanKind": "INTERNAL",
  "eventTime": 1597820253450580272,
  "eventName": "exception",
  "attributes": {
    "exception.type": "org.openqa.selenium.ScriptTimeoutException",
    "exception.message": "Unable to execute request: java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Table 'mysql.sessions_mappa' doesn't exist ..." (full message will be printed),
    "exception.stacktrace": "org.openqa.selenium.ScriptTimeoutException: java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Table 'mysql.sessions_mappa' doesn't exist\nBuild info: version: '4.0.0-alpha-7', revision: 'Unknown'\nSystem info: host: 'XYZ-MacBook-Pro.local', ip: 'fe80:0:0:0:10d5:b63a:bdc6:1aff%en0', os.name: 'Mac OS X', os.arch: 'x86_64', os.version: '10.13.6', java.version: '11.0.7'\nDriver info: driver.version: unknown ...." (full stack will be printed),
    "http.handler_class": "org.openqa.selenium.grid.distributor.remote.RemoteDistributor",
    "http.url": "\u002fsession",
    "http.method": "POST"
  }
}
Note: Logs are pretty printed above for readability. Pretty printing for logs is turned off in Selenium server.

The steps above should set you up for seeing traces and logs.

GraphQL query support
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It gives users the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.

Enums
Enums represent possible sets of values for a field.

For example, the Node object has a field called status. The state is an enum (specifically, of type Status) because it may be UP , DRAINING or UNAVAILABLE.

Scalars
Scalars are primitive values: Int, Float, String, Boolean, or ID.

When calling the GraphQL API, you must specify nested subfield until you return only scalars.

Structure of the Schema
The structure of grid schema is as follows:

{
    session(id: "<session-id>") : {
        id,
        capabilities,
        startTime,
        uri,

        nodeUri,
        sessionDurationMillis

        sessionQueueSize
    }
    sessionsInfo: {

                        capabilities,
                        startTime,
                        uri,
                        nodeId,
                        nodeUri,
                        sessionDurationMillis

                            id,
                            stereotype,
                            lastStarted
                        }
                    }
                ],
                sessionCount,

                    arch,
                    name,
                    version
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
Querying GraphQL
The best way to query GraphQL is by using curl requests. The query is interpreted as JSON. Ensure double quotes are properly escaped to avoid unexpected errors. GraphQL allows you to fetch only the data that you want, nothing more nothing less.

Some of the example GraphQL queries are given below. You can build your own queries as you like.

Querying the number of maxSession and sessionCount in the grid :

Grid endpoints
Grid
Grid Status
Grid status provides the current state of the Grid. It consists of details about every registered Node. For every Node, the status includes information regarding Node availability, sessions, and slots.

cURL GET 'http://localhost:4444/status'
Delete session
Deleting the session terminates the WebDriver session, quits the driver and removes it from the active sessions map. Any request using the removed session-id or reusing the driver instance will throw an error.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4444/session/<session-id>'
Which URL should I use?
In the Standalone mode, the Grid URL is the Standalone server address.

In the Hub-Node mode, the Grid URL is the Hub server address.

In the fully distributed mode, the Grid URL is the Router server address.

Default URL for all the above modes is http://localhost:4444.

Distributor
Remove Node
To remove the Node from the Grid, use the cURL command enlisted below. It does not stop any ongoing session running on that Node. The Node continues running as it is unless explicitly killed. The Distributor is no longer aware of the Node and hence any matching new session request will not be forwarded to that Node.

In the Standalone mode, the Distributor URL is the Standalone server address.

In the Hub-Node mode, the Distributor URL is the Hub server address.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret> '
In the fully distributed mode, the URL is the Router server address.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request DELETE 'http://<Router-URL>/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
Drain Node
Node drain command is for graceful node shutdown. Draining a Node stops the Node after all the ongoing sessions are complete. However, it does not accept any new session requests.

In the Standalone mode, the Distributor URL is the Standalone server address.

In the Hub-Node mode, the Distributor URL is the Hub server address.

cURL --request POST 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>/drain' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret> '
In the fully distributed mode, the URL is the Router server address.

cURL --request POST 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>/drain' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request POST 'http://<Router-URL>/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>/drain' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
Node
The endpoints in this section are applicable for Hub-Node mode and fully distributed Grid mode where the Node runs independently. The default Node URL is http://localhost:5555 in case of one Node. In case of multiple Nodes, use Grid status to get all Node details and locate the Node address.

Status
The Node status is essentially a health-check for the Node. Distributor pings the node status are regular intervals and updates the Grid Model accordingly. The status includes information regarding availability, sessions, and slots.

cURL --request GET 'http://localhost:5555/status'
Drain
Distributor passes the drain command to the appropriate node identified by the node-id. To drain the Node directly, use the cuRL command enlisted below. Both endpoints are valid and produce the same result. Drain finishes the ongoing sessions before stopping the Node.

cURL --request POST 'http://localhost:5555/se/grid/node/drain' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request POST 'http://<node-URL>/se/grid/node/drain' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
Check session owner
To check if a session belongs to a Node, use the cURL command enlisted below.

cURL --request GET 'http://localhost:5555/se/grid/node/owner/<session-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request GET 'http://<node-URL>/se/grid/node/owner/<session-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
It will return true if the session belongs to the Node else it will return false.

Delete session
Deleting the session terminates the WebDriver session, quits the driver and removes it from the active sessions map. Any request using the removed session-id or reusing the driver instance will throw an error.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:5555/se/grid/node/session/<session-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request DELETE 'http://<node-URL>/se/grid/node/session/<session-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
New Session Queue
Clear New Session Queue
New Session Request Queue holds the new session requests. To clear the queue, use the cURL command enlisted below. Clearing the queue rejects all the requests in the queue. For each such request, the server returns an error response to the respective client. The result of the clear command is the total number of deleted requests.

In the Standalone mode, the Queue URL is the Standalone server address.

In the Hub-Node mode, the Queue URL is the Hub server address.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/newsessionqueue/queue' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
In the fully distributed mode, the Queue URL is Router server address.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/newsessionqueue/queue' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request DELETE 'http://<Router-URL>/se/grid/newsessionqueue/queue' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
Get New Session Queue Requests
New Session Request Queue holds the new session requests. To get the current requests in the queue, use the cURL command enlisted below. The response returns the total number of requests in the queue and the request payloads.

In the Standalone mode, the Queue URL is the Standalone server address.

In the Hub-Node mode, the Queue URL is the Hub server address.

cURL --request GET 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/newsessionqueue/queue'
In the fully distributed mode, the Queue URL is Router server address.

cURL --request GET 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/newsessionqueue/queue'

Database backed Session Map
Steps
Redis backed Session Map
Steps
Introduction
Selenium Grid allows you to persist information related to currently running sessions into an external data store. The external data store could be backed by your favourite database (or) Redis Cache system.

Setup
Coursier - As a dependency resolver, so that we can download maven artifacts on the fly and make them available in our classpath
Docker - To manage our PostGreSQL/Redis docker containers.
Database backed Session Map
For the sake of this illustration, we are going to work with PostGreSQL database.

We will spin off a PostGreSQL database as a docker container using a docker compose file.

Steps
You can skip this step if you already have a PostGreSQL database instance available at your disposal.

Create a sql file named init.sql with the below contents:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sessions_map(
    session_ids varchar(256),
    session_caps text,
    session_uri varchar(256),
    session_stereotype text,
    session_start varchar(256)
 );
In the same directory as the init.sql, create a file named docker-compose.yml with its contents as below:
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:9.6-bullseye
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=seluser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=seluser
      - POSTGRES_DB=selenium_sessions
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
    - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
We can now start our database container by running:

docker-compose up -d
Our database name is selenium_sessions with its username and password set to seluser

If you are working with an already running PostGreSQL DB instance, then you just need to create a database named selenium_sessions and the table sessions_map using the above mentioned SQL statement.

Create a Selenium Grid configuration file named sessions.toml with the below contents:
[sessions]
implementation = "org.openqa.selenium.grid.sessionmap.jdbc.JdbcBackedSessionMap"
jdbc-url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/selenium_sessions"
jdbc-user = "seluser"
jdbc-password = "seluser"
Note: If you plan to use an existing PostGreSQL DB instance, then replace localhost:5432 with the actual host and port number of your instance.

Below is a simple shell script (let’s call it distributed.sh) that we will use to bring up our distributed Grid.
SE_VERSION=<current_selenium_version>
JAR_NAME=selenium-server-${SE_VERSION}.jar
PUBLISH="--publish-events tcp://localhost:4442"
SUBSCRIBE="--subscribe-events tcp://localhost:4443"
SESSIONS="--sessions http://localhost:5556"
SESSIONS_QUEUE="--sessionqueue http://localhost:5559"
echo 'Starting Event Bus'
java -jar $JAR_NAME event-bus $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE --port 5557 &
echo 'Starting New Session Queue'
java -jar $JAR_NAME sessionqueue --port 5559 &
echo 'Starting Sessions Map'
java -jar $JAR_NAME \
--ext $(coursier fetch -p org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-session-map-jdbc:${SE_VERSION} org.postgresql:postgresql:42.3.1) \
sessions $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE --port 5556 --config sessions.toml &
echo 'Starting Distributor'
java -jar $JAR_NAME  distributor $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE $SESSIONS $SESSIONS_QUEUE --port 5553 --bind-bus false &
echo 'Starting Router'
java -jar $JAR_NAME router $SESSIONS --distributor http://localhost:5553 $SESSIONS_QUEUE --port 4444 &
echo 'Starting Node'
java -jar $JAR_NAME node $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE &
At this point the current directory should contain the following files:

docker-compose.yml
init.sql
sessions.toml
distributed.sh
You can now spawn the Grid by running distributed.sh shell script and quickly run a test. You will notice that the Grid now stores session information into the PostGreSQL database.

In the line which spawns a SessionMap on a machine:

export SE_VERSION=<current_selenium_version>
java -jar selenium-server-${SE_VERSION}.jar \
--ext $(coursier fetch -p org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-session-map-jdbc:${SE_VERSION} org.postgresql:postgresql:42.3.1) \
sessions --publish-events tcp://localhost:4442 \
--subscribe-events tcp://localhost:4443 \
--port 5556 --config sessions.toml 
The variable names from the above script have been replaced with their actual values for clarity.
Remember to substitute localhost with the actual hostname of the machine where your Event-Bus is running.
The arguments being passed to coursier are basically the GAV (Group Artifact Version) Maven co-ordinates of:
selenium-session-map-jdbc which is needed to help us store sessions information in database
postgresql which is needed to help us talk PostGreSQL database.
sessions.toml is the configuration file that we created earlier.
Redis backed Session Map
We will spin off a Redis Cache docker container using a docker compose file.

Steps
You can skip this step if you already have a Redis Cache instance available at your disposal.

Create a file named docker-compose.yml with its contents as below:
version: '3.8'
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:bullseye
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
We can now start our Redis container by running:

docker-compose up -d
Create a Selenium Grid configuration file named sessions.toml with the below contents:
[sessions]
scheme = "redis"
implementation = "org.openqa.selenium.grid.sessionmap.redis.RedisBackedSessionMap"
hostname = "localhost"
port = 6379
Note: If you plan to use an existing Redis Cache instance, then replace localhost and 6379 with the actual host and port number of your instance.

Below is a simple shell script (let’s call it distributed.sh) that we will use to bring up our distributed grid.
SE_VERSION=<current_selenium_version>
JAR_NAME=selenium-server-${SE_VERSION}.jar
PUBLISH="--publish-events tcp://localhost:4442"
SUBSCRIBE="--subscribe-events tcp://localhost:4443"
SESSIONS="--sessions http://localhost:5556"
SESSIONS_QUEUE="--sessionqueue http://localhost:5559"
echo 'Starting Event Bus'
java -jar $JAR_NAME event-bus $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE --port 5557 &
echo 'Starting New Session Queue'
java -jar $JAR_NAME sessionqueue --port 5559 &
echo 'Starting Session Map'
java -jar $JAR_NAME \
--ext $(coursier fetch -p org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-session-map-redis:${SE_VERSION}) \
sessions $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE --port 5556 --config sessions.toml &
echo 'Starting Distributor'
java -jar $JAR_NAME  distributor $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE $SESSIONS $SESSIONS_QUEUE --port 5553 --bind-bus false &
echo 'Starting Router'
java -jar $JAR_NAME router $SESSIONS --distributor http://localhost:5553 $SESSIONS_QUEUE --port 4444 &
echo 'Starting Node'
java -jar $JAR_NAME node $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE &
At this point the current directory should contain the following files:

docker-compose.yml
sessions.toml
distributed.sh
You can now spawn the Grid by running distributed.sh shell script and quickly run a test. You will notice that the Grid now stores session information into the Redis instance. You can perhaps make use of a Redis GUI such as TablePlus to see them (Make sure that you have setup a debug point in your test, because the values will get deleted as soon as the test runs to completion).

In the line which spawns a SessionMap on a machine:

export SE_VERSION=<current_selenium_version>
java -jar selenium-server-${SE_VERSION}.jar \
--ext $(coursier fetch -p org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-session-map-redis:${SE_VERSION}) \
sessions --publish-events tcp://localhost:4442 \
--subscribe-events tcp://localhost:4443 \
--port 5556 --config sessions.toml

Selenium Grid
Grid aids in scaling and distributing tests by executing tests on various browser and operating system combinations.

Observability
Observability has three pillars: traces, metrics and logs. Since Selenium Grid 4 is designed to be fully distributed, observability will make it easier to understand and debug the internals.

Distributed tracing
A single request or transaction spans multiple services and components. Tracing tracks the request lifecycle as each service executes the request. It is useful in debugging in an error scenario. Some key terms used in tracing context are:

Trace Tracing allows one to trace a request through multiple services, starting from its origin to its final destination. This request’s journey helps in debugging, monitoring the end-to-end flow, and identifying failures. A trace depicts the end-to-end request flow. Each trace has a unique id as its identifier.

Span Each trace is made up of timed operations called spans. A span has a start and end time and it represents operations done by a service. The granularity of span depends on how it is instrumented. Each span has a unique identifier. All spans within a trace have the same trace id.

Span Attributes Span attributes are key-value pairs which provide additional information about each span.

Events Events are timed-stamped logs within a span. They provide additional context to the existing spans. Events also contain key-value pairs as event attributes.

Event logging
Logging is essential to debug an application. Logging is often done in a human-readable format. But for machines to search and analyze the logs, it has to have a well-defined format. Structured logging is a common practice of recording logs consistently in a fixed format. It commonly contains fields like:

Timestamp
Logging level
Logger class
Log message (This is further broken down into fields relevant to the operation where the log was recorded)
Logs and events are closely related. Events encapsulate all the possible information available to do a single unit of work. Logs are essentially subsets of an event. At the crux, both aid in debugging. Refer following resources for detailed understanding:

https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/how-are-structured-logs-different-from-events/
https://charity.wtf/2019/02/05/logs-vs-structured-events/
Grid Observability
Selenium server is instrumented with tracing using OpenTelemetry. Every request to the server is traced from start to end. Each trace consists of a series of spans as a request is executed within the server. Most spans in the Selenium server consist of two events:

Normal event - records all information about a unit of work and marks successful completion of the work.
Error event - records all information till the error occurs and then records the error information. Marks an exception event.
Running Selenium server

Standalone
Hub and Node
Fully Distributed
Docker
Visualizing Traces
All spans, events and their respective attributes are part of a trace. Tracing works while running the server in all of the above-mentioned modes.

By default, tracing is enabled in the Selenium server. Selenium server exports the traces via two exporters:

Console - Logs all traces and their included spans at FINE level. By default, Selenium server prints logs at INFO level and above. The log-level flag can be used to pass a logging level of choice while running the Selenium Grid jar/s.
java -jar selenium-server-4.0.0-<selenium-version>.jar standalone --log-level FINE
Jaeger UI - OpenTelemetry provides the APIs and SDKs to instrument traces in the code. Whereas Jaeger is a tracing backend, that aids in collecting the tracing telemetry data and providing querying, filtering and visualizing features for the data.
Detailed instructions of visualizing traces using Jaeger UI can be obtained by running the command :

java -jar selenium-server-4.0.0-<selenium-version>.jar info tracing
A very good example and scripts to run the server and send traces to Jaeger

Leveraging event logs
Tracing has to be enabled for event logging as well, even if one does not wish to export traces to visualize them.
By default, tracing is enabled. No additional parameters need to be passed to see logs on the console. All events within a span are logged at FINE level. Error events are logged at WARN level.

All event logs have the following fields :

Field	Field value	Description
Event time	eventId	Timestamp of the event record in epoch nanoseconds.
Trace Id	tracedId	Each trace is uniquely identified by a trace id.
Span Id	spanId	Each span within a trace is uniquely identified by a span id.
Span Kind	spanKind	Span kind is a property of span indicating the type of span. It helps in understanding the nature of the unit of work done by the Span.
Event name	eventName	This maps to the log message.
Event attributes	eventAttributes	This forms the crux of the event logs, based on the operation executed, it has JSON formatted key-value pairs. This also includes a handler class attribute, to show the logger class.
Sample log

FINE [LoggingOptions$1.lambda$export$1] - {
  "traceId": "fc8aef1d44b3cc8bc09eb8e581c4a8eb",
  "spanId": "b7d3b9865d3ddd45",
  "spanKind": "INTERNAL",
  "eventTime": 1597819675128886121,
  "eventName": "Session request execution complete",
  "attributes": {
    "http.status_code": 200,
    "http.handler_class": "org.openqa.selenium.grid.router.HandleSession",
    "http.url": "\u002fsession\u002fdd35257f104bb43fdfb06242953f4c85",
    "http.method": "DELETE",
    "session.id": "dd35257f104bb43fdfb06242953f4c85"
  }
}
In addition to the above fields, based on OpenTelemetry specification error logs consist of :

Field	Field value	Description
Exception type	exception.type	The class name of the exception.
Exception message	exception.message	Reason for the exception.
Exception stacktrace	exception.stacktrace	Prints the call stack at the point of time when the exception was thrown. Helps in understanding the origin of the exception.
Sample error log

WARN [LoggingOptions$1.lambda$export$1] - {
  "traceId": "7efa5ea57e02f89cdf8de586fe09f564",
  "spanId": "914df6bc9a1f6e2b",
  "spanKind": "INTERNAL",
  "eventTime": 1597820253450580272,
  "eventName": "exception",
  "attributes": {
    "exception.type": "org.openqa.selenium.ScriptTimeoutException",
    "exception.message": "Unable to execute request: java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Table 'mysql.sessions_mappa' doesn't exist ..." (full message will be printed),
    "exception.stacktrace": "org.openqa.selenium.ScriptTimeoutException: java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Table 'mysql.sessions_mappa' doesn't exist\nBuild info: version: '4.0.0-alpha-7', revision: 'Unknown'\nSystem info: host: 'XYZ-MacBook-Pro.local', ip: 'fe80:0:0:0:10d5:b63a:bdc6:1aff%en0', os.name: 'Mac OS X', os.arch: 'x86_64', os.version: '10.13.6', java.version: '11.0.7'\nDriver info: driver.version: unknown ...." (full stack will be printed),
    "http.handler_class": "org.openqa.selenium.grid.distributor.remote.RemoteDistributor",
    "http.url": "\u002fsession",
    "http.method": "POST"
  }
}
Note: Logs are pretty printed above for readability. Pretty printing for logs is turned off in Selenium server.

The steps above should set you up for seeing traces and logs.

GraphQL query support
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It gives users the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.

Enums
Enums represent possible sets of values for a field.

For example, the Node object has a field called status. The state is an enum (specifically, of type Status) because it may be UP , DRAINING or UNAVAILABLE.

Scalars
Scalars are primitive values: Int, Float, String, Boolean, or ID.

When calling the GraphQL API, you must specify nested subfield until you return only scalars.

        ]
    }

Querying GraphQL
The best way to query GraphQL is by using curl requests. The query is interpreted as JSON. Ensure double quotes are properly escaped to avoid unexpected errors. GraphQL allows you to fetch only the data that you want, nothing more nothing less.

Some of the example GraphQL queries are given below. You can build your own queries as you like.

Querying the number of maxSession and sessionCount in the grid :
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query": "{ grid { maxSession, sessionCount } }"}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>
Generally on local machine the <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT> would be http://localhost:4444/graphql

Querying all details for session, node and the Grid :
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query":"{ grid { uri, maxSession, sessionCount }, nodesInfo { nodes { id, uri, status, sessions { id, capabilities, startTime, uri, nodeId, nodeUri, sessionDurationMillis, slot { id, stereotype, lastStarted } }, slotCount, sessionCount }} }"}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>
Query for getting the current session count in the Grid :
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query":"{ grid { sessionCount } }"}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>
Query for getting the max session count in the Grid :
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query":"{ grid { maxSession } }"}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>
Query for getting all session details for all nodes in the Grid :
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query":"{ sessionsInfo { sessions { id, capabilities, startTime, uri, nodeId, nodeId, sessionDurationMillis } } }"}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>
Query to get slot information for all sessions in each Node in the Grid :
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query":"{ sessionsInfo { sessions { id, slot { id, stereotype, lastStarted } } } }"}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>
Query to get session information for a given session:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query":"{ session (id: \"<session-id>\") { id, capabilities, startTime, uri, nodeId, nodeUri, sessionDurationMillis, slot { id, stereotype, lastStarted } } } "}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>
Querying the capabilities of each node in the grid :
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query": "{ nodesInfo { nodes { stereotypes } } }"}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>
Querying the status of each node in the grid :
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query": "{ nodesInfo { nodes { status } } }"}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>
Querying the URI of each node and the grid :
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query": "{ nodesInfo { nodes { uri } } }"}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>
Query for getting the current requests in the New Session Queue:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query":"{ sessionsInfo { sessionQueueRequests } }"}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>
Query for getting the New Session Queue size :
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"query":"{ grid { sessionQueueSize } }"}' -s <LINK_TO_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>

Grid endpoints
Grid
Grid Status
Grid status provides the current state of the Grid. It consists of details about every registered Node. For every Node, the status includes information regarding Node availability, sessions, and slots.

cURL GET 'http://localhost:4444/status'
Delete session
Deleting the session terminates the WebDriver session, quits the driver and removes it from the active sessions map. Any request using the removed session-id or reusing the driver instance will throw an error.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4444/session/<session-id>'
Which URL should I use?
In the Standalone mode, the Grid URL is the Standalone server address.

In the Hub-Node mode, the Grid URL is the Hub server address.

In the fully distributed mode, the Grid URL is the Router server address.

Default URL for all the above modes is http://localhost:4444.

Distributor
Remove Node
To remove the Node from the Grid, use the cURL command enlisted below. It does not stop any ongoing session running on that Node. The Node continues running as it is unless explicitly killed. The Distributor is no longer aware of the Node and hence any matching new session request will not be forwarded to that Node.

In the Standalone mode, the Distributor URL is the Standalone server address.

In the Hub-Node mode, the Distributor URL is the Hub server address.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret> '
In the fully distributed mode, the URL is the Router server address.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request DELETE 'http://<Router-URL>/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
Drain Node
Node drain command is for graceful node shutdown. Draining a Node stops the Node after all the ongoing sessions are complete. However, it does not accept any new session requests.

In the Standalone mode, the Distributor URL is the Standalone server address.

In the Hub-Node mode, the Distributor URL is the Hub server address.

cURL --request POST 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>/drain' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret> '
In the fully distributed mode, the URL is the Router server address.

cURL --request POST 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>/drain' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request POST 'http://<Router-URL>/se/grid/distributor/node/<node-id>/drain' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
Node
The endpoints in this section are applicable for Hub-Node mode and fully distributed Grid mode where the Node runs independently. The default Node URL is http://localhost:5555 in case of one Node. In case of multiple Nodes, use Grid status to get all Node details and locate the Node address.

Status
The Node status is essentially a health-check for the Node. Distributor pings the node status are regular intervals and updates the Grid Model accordingly. The status includes information regarding availability, sessions, and slots.

cURL --request GET 'http://localhost:5555/status'
Drain
Distributor passes the drain command to the appropriate node identified by the node-id. To drain the Node directly, use the cuRL command enlisted below. Both endpoints are valid and produce the same result. Drain finishes the ongoing sessions before stopping the Node.

cURL --request POST 'http://localhost:5555/se/grid/node/drain' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request POST 'http://<node-URL>/se/grid/node/drain' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
Check session owner
To check if a session belongs to a Node, use the cURL command enlisted below.

cURL --request GET 'http://localhost:5555/se/grid/node/owner/<session-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request GET 'http://<node-URL>/se/grid/node/owner/<session-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
It will return true if the session belongs to the Node else it will return false.

Delete session
Deleting the session terminates the WebDriver session, quits the driver and removes it from the active sessions map. Any request using the removed session-id or reusing the driver instance will throw an error.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:5555/se/grid/node/session/<session-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request DELETE 'http://<node-URL>/se/grid/node/session/<session-id>' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
New Session Queue
Clear New Session Queue
New Session Request Queue holds the new session requests. To clear the queue, use the cURL command enlisted below. Clearing the queue rejects all the requests in the queue. For each such request, the server returns an error response to the respective client. The result of the clear command is the total number of deleted requests.

In the Standalone mode, the Queue URL is the Standalone server address.

In the Hub-Node mode, the Queue URL is the Hub server address.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/newsessionqueue/queue' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
In the fully distributed mode, the Queue URL is Router server address.

cURL --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/newsessionqueue/queue' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET: <secret>'
If no registration secret has been configured while setting up the Grid, then use

cURL --request DELETE 'http://<Router-URL>/se/grid/newsessionqueue/queue' --header 'X-REGISTRATION-SECRET;'
Get New Session Queue Requests
New Session Request Queue holds the new session requests. To get the current requests in the queue, use the cURL command enlisted below. The response returns the total number of requests in the queue and the request payloads.

In the Standalone mode, the Queue URL is the Standalone server address.

In the Hub-Node mode, the Queue URL is the Hub server address.

cURL --request GET 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/newsessionqueue/queue'
In the fully distributed mode, the Queue URL is Router server address.

cURL --request GET 'http://localhost:4444/se/grid/newsessionqueue/queue'

Customizing a Node
How to customize a Node
There are times when we would like a Node to be customized to our needs.

For e.g., we may like to do some additional setup before a session begins execution and some clean-up after a session runs to completion.

Following steps can be followed for this:

Create a class that extends org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.Node

Add a static method (this will be our factory method) to the newly created class whose signature looks like this:

public static Node create(Config config). Here:

Node is of type org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.Node
Config is of type org.openqa.selenium.grid.config.Config
Within this factory method, include logic for creating your new Class.

To wire in this new customized logic into the hub, start the node and pass in the fully qualified class name of the above class to the argument --node-implementation

Let’s see an example of all this:

Custom Node as an uber jar
Create a sample project using your favourite build tool (Maven|Gradle).
Add the below dependency to your sample project.
org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-grid
Add your customized Node to the project.
Build an uber jar to be able to start the Node using java -jar command.
Now start the Node using the command:
java -jar custom_node-server.jar node \
--node-implementation org.seleniumhq.samples.DecoratedLoggingNode
Note: If you are using Maven as a build tool, please prefer using maven-shade-plugin instead of maven-assembly-plugin because maven-assembly plugin seems to have issues with being able to merge multiple Service Provider Interface files (META-INF/services)

Custom Node as a regular jar
Create a sample project using your favourite build tool (Maven|Gradle).
Add the below dependency to your sample project.
org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-grid
Add your customized Node to the project.
Build a jar of your project using your build tool.
Now start the Node using the command:
java -jar selenium-server-4.6.0.jar \
--ext custom_node-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar node \
--node-implementation org.seleniumhq.samples.DecoratedLoggingNode
Below is a sample that just prints some messages on to the console whenever there’s an activity of interest (session created, session deleted, a webdriver command executed etc.,) on the Node.

Sample customized node
Foot Notes:

In the above example, the line Node node = LocalNodeFactory.create(config); explicitly creates a LocalNode.

There are basically 2 types of user facing implementations of org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.Node available.

These classes are good starting points to learn how to build a custom Node and also to learn the internals of a Node.

org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.local.LocalNode - Used to represent a long running Node and is the default implementation that gets wired in when you start a node.
It can be created by calling LocalNodeFactory.create(config);, where:
LocalNodeFactory belongs to org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.local
Config belongs to org.openqa.selenium.grid.config
org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.k8s.OneShotNode - This is a special reference implementation wherein the Node gracefully shuts itself down after servicing one test session. This class is currently not available as part of any pre-built maven artifact.
You can refer to the source code here to understand its internals.
To build it locally refer here.
It can be created by calling OneShotNode.create(config), where:
OneShotNode belongs to org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.k8s
Config belongs to org.openqa.selenium.grid.config

External datastore
Table of Contents
Introduction
Setup
Database backed Session Map
Steps
Redis backed Session Map
Steps
Introduction
Selenium Grid allows you to persist information related to currently running sessions into an external data store. The external data store could be backed by your favourite database (or) Redis Cache system.

Setup
Coursier - As a dependency resolver, so that we can download maven artifacts on the fly and make them available in our classpath
Docker - To manage our PostGreSQL/Redis docker containers.
Database backed Session Map
For the sake of this illustration, we are going to work with PostGreSQL database.

We will spin off a PostGreSQL database as a docker container using a docker compose file.

Steps
You can skip this step if you already have a PostGreSQL database instance available at your disposal.

Create a sql file named init.sql with the below contents:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sessions_map(
    session_ids varchar(256),
    session_caps text,
    session_uri varchar(256),
    session_stereotype text,
    session_start varchar(256)
 );
In the same directory as the init.sql, create a file named docker-compose.yml with its contents as below:
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:9.6-bullseye
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=seluser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=seluser
      - POSTGRES_DB=selenium_sessions
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
    - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
We can now start our database container by running:

docker-compose up -d
Our database name is selenium_sessions with its username and password set to seluser

If you are working with an already running PostGreSQL DB instance, then you just need to create a database named selenium_sessions and the table sessions_map using the above mentioned SQL statement.

Create a Selenium Grid configuration file named sessions.toml with the below contents:
[sessions]
implementation = "org.openqa.selenium.grid.sessionmap.jdbc.JdbcBackedSessionMap"
jdbc-url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/selenium_sessions"
jdbc-user = "seluser"
jdbc-password = "seluser"
Note: If you plan to use an existing PostGreSQL DB instance, then replace localhost:5432 with the actual host and port number of your instance.

Below is a simple shell script (let’s call it distributed.sh) that we will use to bring up our distributed Grid.
SE_VERSION=<current_selenium_version>
JAR_NAME=selenium-server-${SE_VERSION}.jar
PUBLISH="--publish-events tcp://localhost:4442"
SUBSCRIBE="--subscribe-events tcp://localhost:4443"
SESSIONS="--sessions http://localhost:5556"
SESSIONS_QUEUE="--sessionqueue http://localhost:5559"
echo 'Starting Event Bus'
java -jar $JAR_NAME event-bus $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE --port 5557 &
echo 'Starting New Session Queue'
java -jar $JAR_NAME sessionqueue --port 5559 &
echo 'Starting Sessions Map'
java -jar $JAR_NAME \
--ext $(coursier fetch -p org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-session-map-jdbc:${SE_VERSION} org.postgresql:postgresql:42.3.1) \
sessions $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE --port 5556 --config sessions.toml &
echo 'Starting Distributor'
java -jar $JAR_NAME  distributor $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE $SESSIONS $SESSIONS_QUEUE --port 5553 --bind-bus false &
echo 'Starting Router'
java -jar $JAR_NAME router $SESSIONS --distributor http://localhost:5553 $SESSIONS_QUEUE --port 4444 &
echo 'Starting Node'
java -jar $JAR_NAME node $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE &
At this point the current directory should contain the following files:

docker-compose.yml
init.sql
sessions.toml
distributed.sh
You can now spawn the Grid by running distributed.sh shell script and quickly run a test. You will notice that the Grid now stores session information into the PostGreSQL database.

In the line which spawns a SessionMap on a machine:

export SE_VERSION=<current_selenium_version>
java -jar selenium-server-${SE_VERSION}.jar \
--ext $(coursier fetch -p org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-session-map-jdbc:${SE_VERSION} org.postgresql:postgresql:42.3.1) \
sessions --publish-events tcp://localhost:4442 \
--subscribe-events tcp://localhost:4443 \
--port 5556 --config sessions.toml 
The variable names from the above script have been replaced with their actual values for clarity.
Remember to substitute localhost with the actual hostname of the machine where your Event-Bus is running.
The arguments being passed to coursier are basically the GAV (Group Artifact Version) Maven co-ordinates of:
selenium-session-map-jdbc which is needed to help us store sessions information in database
postgresql which is needed to help us talk PostGreSQL database.
sessions.toml is the configuration file that we created earlier.
Redis backed Session Map
We will spin off a Redis Cache docker container using a docker compose file.

Steps
You can skip this step if you already have a Redis Cache instance available at your disposal.

Create a file named docker-compose.yml with its contents as below:
version: '3.8'
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:bullseye
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
We can now start our Redis container by running:

docker-compose up -d
Create a Selenium Grid configuration file named sessions.toml with the below contents:
[sessions]
scheme = "redis"
implementation = "org.openqa.selenium.grid.sessionmap.redis.RedisBackedSessionMap"
hostname = "localhost"
port = 6379
Note: If you plan to use an existing Redis Cache instance, then replace localhost and 6379 with the actual host and port number of your instance.

Below is a simple shell script (let’s call it distributed.sh) that we will use to bring up our distributed grid.
SE_VERSION=<current_selenium_version>
JAR_NAME=selenium-server-${SE_VERSION}.jar
PUBLISH="--publish-events tcp://localhost:4442"
SUBSCRIBE="--subscribe-events tcp://localhost:4443"
SESSIONS="--sessions http://localhost:5556"
SESSIONS_QUEUE="--sessionqueue http://localhost:5559"
echo 'Starting Event Bus'
java -jar $JAR_NAME event-bus $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE --port 5557 &
echo 'Starting New Session Queue'
java -jar $JAR_NAME sessionqueue --port 5559 &
echo 'Starting Session Map'
java -jar $JAR_NAME \
--ext $(coursier fetch -p org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-session-map-redis:${SE_VERSION}) \
sessions $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE --port 5556 --config sessions.toml &
echo 'Starting Distributor'
java -jar $JAR_NAME  distributor $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE $SESSIONS $SESSIONS_QUEUE --port 5553 --bind-bus false &
echo 'Starting Router'
java -jar $JAR_NAME router $SESSIONS --distributor http://localhost:5553 $SESSIONS_QUEUE --port 4444 &
echo 'Starting Node'
java -jar $JAR_NAME node $PUBLISH $SUBSCRIBE &
At this point the current directory should contain the following files:

docker-compose.yml
sessions.toml
distributed.sh
You can now spawn the Grid by running distributed.sh shell script and quickly run a test. You will notice that the Grid now stores session information into the Redis instance. You can perhaps make use of a Redis GUI such as TablePlus to see them (Make sure that you have setup a debug point in your test, because the values will get deleted as soon as the test runs to completion).

In the line which spawns a SessionMap on a machine:

export SE_VERSION=<current_selenium_version>
java -jar selenium-server-${SE_VERSION}.jar \
--ext $(coursier fetch -p org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-session-map-redis:${SE_VERSION}) \
sessions --publish-events tcp://localhost:4442 \
--subscribe-events tcp://localhost:4443 \
--port 5556 --config sessions.toml 
The variable names from the above script have been replaced with their actual values for clarity.
Remember to substitute localhost with the actual hostname of the machine where your Event-Bus is running.
The arguments being passed to coursier are basically the GAV (Group Artifact Version) Maven co-ordinates of:
selenium-session-map-redis which is needed to help us store sessions information in Redis Cache.
sessions.toml is the configuration file that we created earlier.

About Selenium


IE Driver Server
The Internet Explorer Driver is a standalone server that implements the WebDriver specification.
This documentation previously located on the wiki

The InternetExplorerDriver is a standalone server which implements WebDriver’s wire protocol. This driver has been tested with IE 11, and on Windows 10. It might work with older versions of IE and Windows, but this is not supported.

The driver supports running 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the browser. The choice of how to determine which “bit-ness” to use in launching the browser depends on which version of the IEDriverServer.exe is launched. If the 32-bit version of IEDriverServer.exe is launched, the 32-bit version of IE will be launched. Similarly, if the 64-bit version of IEDriverServer.exe is launched, the 64-bit version of IE will be launched.

Installing
You do not need to run an installer before using the InternetExplorerDriver, though some configuration is required. The standalone server executable must be downloaded from the Downloads page and placed in your PATH.

Pros
Runs in a real browser and supports JavaScript
Cons
Obviously the InternetExplorerDriver will only work on Windows!
Comparatively slow (though still pretty snappy :)
Command-Line Switches
As a standalone executable, the behavior of the IE driver can be modified through various command-line arguments. To set the value of these command-line arguments, you should consult the documentation for the language binding you are using. The command line switches supported are described in the table below. All -<switch>, –<switch> and /<switch> are supported.

Switch	Meaning
–port=<portNumber>	Specifies the port on which the HTTP server of the IE driver will listen for commands from language bindings. Defaults to 5555.
–host=<hostAdapterIPAddress>	Specifies the IP address of the host adapter on which the HTTP server of the IE driver will listen for commands from language bindings. Defaults to 127.0.0.1.
–log-level=<logLevel>	Specifies the level at which logging messages are output. Valid values are FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, and TRACE. Defaults to FATAL.
–log-file=<logFile>	Specifies the full path and file name of the log file. Defaults to stdout.
–extract-path=<path>	Specifies the full path to the directory used to extract supporting files used by the server. Defaults to the TEMP directory if not specified.
–silent	Suppresses diagnostic output when the server is started.
Important System Properties
The following system properties (read using System.getProperty() and set using System.setProperty() in Java code or the “-DpropertyName=value” command line flag) are used by the InternetExplorerDriver:

Property	What it means
webdriver.ie.driver	The location of the IE driver binary.
webdriver.ie.driver.host	Specifies the IP address of the host adapter on which the IE driver will listen.
webdriver.ie.driver.loglevel	Specifies the level at which logging messages are output. Valid values are FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, and TRACE. Defaults to FATAL.
webdriver.ie.driver.logfile	Specifies the full path and file name of the log file.
webdriver.ie.driver.silent	Suppresses diagnostic output when the IE driver is started.
webdriver.ie.driver.extractpath	Specifies the full path to the directory used to extract supporting files used by the server. Defaults to the TEMP directory if not specified.
Required Configuration
The IEDriverServer executable must be downloaded and placed in your PATH.
On IE 7 or higher on Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 10, you must set the Protected Mode settings for each zone to be the same value. The value can be on or off, as long as it is the same for every zone. To set the Protected Mode settings, choose “Internet Options…” from the Tools menu, and click on the Security tab. For each zone, there will be a check box at the bottom of the tab labeled “Enable Protected Mode”.
Additionally, “Enhanced Protected Mode” must be disabled for IE 10 and higher. This option is found in the Advanced tab of the Internet Options dialog.
The browser zoom level must be set to 100% so that the native mouse events can be set to the correct coordinates.
For Windows 10, you also need to set “Change the size of text, apps, and other items” to 100% in display settings.
For IE 11 only, you will need to set a registry entry on the target computer so that the driver can maintain a connection to the instance of Internet Explorer it creates. For 32-bit Windows installations, the key you must examine in the registry editor is HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BFCACHE. For 64-bit Windows installations, the key is HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BFCACHE. Please note that the FEATURE_BFCACHE subkey may or may not be present, and should be created if it is not present. Important: Inside this key, create a DWORD value named iexplore.exe with the value of 0.
Native Events and Internet Explorer
As the InternetExplorerDriver is Windows-only, it attempts to use so-called “native”, or OS-level events to perform mouse and keyboard operations in the browser. This is in contrast to using simulated JavaScript events for the same operations. The advantage of using native events is that it does not rely on the JavaScript sandbox, and it ensures proper JavaScript event propagation within the browser. However, there are currently some issues with mouse events when the IE browser window does not have focus, and when attempting to hover over elements.

Browser Focus
The challenge is that IE itself appears to not fully respect the Windows messages we send the IE browser window (WM\_MOUSEDOWN and WM\_MOUSEUP) if the window doesn’t have the focus. Specifically, the element being clicked on will receive a focus window around it, but the click will not be processed by the element. Arguably, we shouldn’t be sending messages at all; rather, we should be using the SendInput() API, but that API explicitly requires the window to have the focus. We have two conflicting goals with the WebDriver project.

First, we strive to emulate the user as closely as possible. This means using native events rather than simulating the events using JavaScript.

Second, we want to not require focus of the browser window being automated. This means that just forcing the browser window to the foreground is suboptimal.

An additional consideration is the possibility of multiple IE instances running under multiple WebDriver instances, which means any such “bring the window to the foreground” solution will have to be wrapped in some sort of synchronizing construct (mutex?) within the IE driver’s C++ code. Even so, this code will still be subject to race conditions, if, for example, the user brings another window to the foreground between the driver bringing IE to the foreground and executing the native event.

The discussion around the requirements of the driver and how to prioritize these two conflicting goals is ongoing. The current prevailing wisdom is to prioritize the former over the latter, and document that your machine will be unavailable for other tasks when using the IE driver. However, that decision is far from finalized, and the code to implement it is likely to be rather complicated.

Hovering Over Elements
When you attempt to hover over elements, and your physical mouse cursor is within the boundaries of the IE browser window, the hover will not work. More specifically, the hover will appear to work for a fraction of a second, and then the element will revert back to its previous state. The prevailing theory why this occurs is that IE is doing hit-testing of some sort during its event loop, which causes it to respond to the physical mouse position when the physical cursor is within the window bounds. The WebDriver development team has been unable to discover a workaround for this behavior of IE.

Clicking <option> Elements or Submitting Forms and alert()
There are two places where the IE driver does not interact with elements using native events. This is in clicking <option> elements within a <select> element. Under normal circumstances, the IE driver calculates where to click based on the position and size of the element, typically as returned by the JavaScript getBoundingClientRect() method. However, for <option> elements, getBoundingClientRect() returns a rectangle with zero position and zero size. The IE driver handles this one scenario by using the click() Automation Atom, which essentially sets the .selected property of the element and simulates the onChange event in JavaScript. However, this means that if the onChange event of the <select> element contains JavaScript code that calls alert(), confirm() or prompt(), calling WebElement’s click() method will hang until the modal dialog is manually dismissed. There is no known workaround for this behavior using only WebDriver code.

Similarly, there are some scenarios when submitting an HTML form via WebElement’s submit() method may have the same effect. This can happen if the driver calls the JavaScript submit() function on the form, and there is an onSubmit event handler that calls the JavaScript alert(), confirm(), or prompt() functions.

This restriction is filed as issue 3508 (on Google Code).

Multiple instances of InternetExplorerDriver
With the creation of the IEDriverServer.exe, it should be possible to create and use multiple simultaneous instances of the InternetExplorerDriver. However, this functionality is largely untested, and there may be issues with cookies, window focus, and the like. If you attempt to use multiple instances of the IE driver, and run into such issues, consider using the RemoteWebDriver and virtual machines.

There are 2 solutions for problem with cookies (and another session items) shared between multiple instances of InternetExplorer.

The first is to start your InternetExplorer in private mode. After that InternetExplorer will be started with clean session data and will not save changed session data at quiting. To do so you need to pass 2 specific capabilities to driver: ie.forceCreateProcessApi with true value and ie.browserCommandLineSwitches with -private value. Be note that it will work only for InternetExplorer 8 and newer, and Windows Registry HKLM_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main path should contain key TabProcGrowth with 0 value.

The second is to clean session during InternetExplorer starting. For this you need to pass specific ie.ensureCleanSession capability with true value to driver. This clears the cache for all running instances of InternetExplorer, including those started manually.

Running IEDriverServer.exe Remotely
The HTTP server started by the IEDriverServer.exe sets an access control list to only accept connections from the local machine, and disallows incoming connections from remote machines. At present, this cannot be changed without modifying the source code to the IEDriverServer.exe. To run the Internet Explorer driver on a remote machine, use the Java standalone remote server in connection with your language binding’s equivalent of RemoteWebDriver.

Running IEDriverServer.exe Under a Windows Service
Attempting to use IEDriverServer.exe as part of a Windows Service application is expressly unsupported. Service processes, and processes spawned by them, have much different requirements than those executing in a regular user context. IEDriverServer.exe is explicitly untested in that environment, and includes Windows API calls that are documented to be prohibited to be used in service processes. While it may be possible to get the IE driver to work while running under a service process, users encountering problems in that environment will need to seek out their own solutions.

Internet Explorer Driver Internals
More detailed information on the IE Driver.
Client Code Into the Driver
We use the W3C WebDriver protocol to communicate with a local instance of an HTTP server. This greatly simplifies the implementation of the language-specific code, and minimzes the number of entry points into the C++ DLL that must be called using a native-code interop technology such as JNA, ctypes, pinvoke or DL.

Memory Management
The IE driver utilizes the Active Template Library (ATL) to take advantage of its implementation of smart pointers to COM objects. This makes reference counting and cleanup of COM objects much easier.

Why Do We Require Protected Mode Settings Changes?
IE 7 on Windows Vista introduced the concept of Protected Mode, which allows for some measure of protection to the underlying Windows OS when browsing. The problem is that when you manipulate an instance of IE via COM, and you navigate to a page that would cause a transition into or out of Protected Mode, IE requires that another browser session be created. This will orphan the COM object of the previous session, not allowing you to control it any longer.

In IE 7, this will usually manifest itself as a new top-level browser window; in IE 8, a new IExplore.exe process will be created, but it will usually (not always!) seamlessly attach it to the existing IE top-level frame window. Any browser automation framework that drives IE externally (as opposed to using a WebBrowser control) will run into these problems.

In order to work around that problem, we dictate that to work with IE, all zones must have the same Protected Mode setting. As long as it’s on for all zones, or off for all zones, we can prevent the transistions to different Protected Mode zones that would invalidate our browser object. It also allows users to continue to run with UAC turned on, and to run securely in the browser if they set Protected Mode “on” for all zones.

In earlier releases of the IE driver, if the user’s Protected Mode settings were not correctly set, we would launch IE, and the process would simply hang until the HTTP request timed out. This was suboptimal, as it gave no indication what needed to be set. Erring on the side of caution, we do not modify the user’s Protected Mode settings. Current versions, however check that the Protected Mode settings are properly set, and will return an error response if they are not.

Keyboard and Mouse Input
Key files: interactions.cpp

There are two ways that we could simulate keyboard and mouse input. The first way, which is used in parts of webdriver, is to synthesize events on the DOM. This has a number of drawbacks, since each browser (and version of a browser) has its own unique quirks; to model each of these is a demanding task, and impossible to get completely right (for example, it’s hard to tell what window.selection should be and this is a read-only property on some browsers) The alternative approach is to synthesize keyboard and mouse input at the OS level, ideally without stealing focus from the user (who tends to be doing other things on their computer as long-running webdriver tests run)

The code for doing this is in interactions.cpp The key thing to note here is that we use PostMessages to push window events on to the message queue of the IE instance. Typing, in particular, is interesting: we only send the “keydown” and “keyup” messages. The “keypress” event is created if necessary by IE’s internal event processing. Because the key press event is not always generated (for example, not every character is printable, and if the default event bubbling is cancelled, listeners don’t see the key press event) we send a “probe” event in after the key down. Once we see that this has been processed, we know that the key press event is on the stack of events to be processed, and that it is safe to send the key up event. If this was not done, it is possible for events to fire in the wrong order, which is definitely sub-optimal.

Working On the InternetExplorerDriver
Currently, there are tests that will run for the InternetExplorerDriver in all languages (Java, C#, Python, and Ruby), so you should be able to test your changes to the native code no matter what language you’re comfortable working in from the client side. For working on the C++ code, you’ll need Visual Studio 2010 Professional or higher. Unfortunately, the C++ code of the driver uses ATL to ease the pain of working with COM objects, and ATL is not supplied with Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition. If you’re using Eclipse, the process for making and testing modifications is:

Edit the C++ code in VS.
Build the code to ensure that it compiles
Do a complete rebuild when you are ready to run a test. This will cause the created DLL to be copied to the right place to allow its use in Eclipse
Load Eclipse (or some other IDE, such as Idea)
Edit the SingleTestSuite so that it is usingDriver(IE)
Create a JUnit run configuration that uses the “webdriver-internet-explorer” project. If you don’t do this, the test won’t work at all, and there will be a somewhat cryptic error message on the console.
Once the basic setup is done, you can start working on the code pretty quickly. You can attach to the process you execute your code from using Visual Studio (from the Debug menu, select Attach to Process…).

Some guidelines and recommendations on testing from the Selenium project.
A note on “Best Practices”: We’ve intentionally avoided the phrase “Best Practices” in this documentation. No one approach works for all situations. We prefer the idea of “Guidelines and Recommendations.” We encourage you to read through these and thoughtfully decide what approaches will work for you in your particular environment.

Functional testing is challenging to get right for many reasons. As if application state, complexity, and dependencies do not make testing difficult enough, dealing with browsers (especially with cross-browser incompatibilities) makes writing good tests a challenge.

Selenium provides tools to make functional user interaction easier, but does not help you write well-architected test suites. In this chapter, we offer advice, guidelines, and recommendations on how to approach functional web page automation.

This chapter records software design patterns popular amongst many of the users of Selenium that have proven successful over the years.

Design patterns and development strategies
(previously located: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Bot-Style-Tests)

Overview
Over time, projects tend to accumulate large numbers of tests. As the total number of tests increases, it becomes harder to make changes to the codebase — a single “simple” change may cause numerous tests to fail, even though the application still works properly. Sometimes these problems are unavoidable, but when they do occur you want to be up and running again as quickly as possible. The following design patterns and strategies have been used before with WebDriver to help make tests easier to write and maintain. They may help you too.

DomainDrivenDesign: Express your tests in the language of the end-user of the app. PageObjects: A simple abstraction of the UI of your web app. LoadableComponent: Modeling PageObjects as components. BotStyleTests: Using a command-based approach to automating tests, rather than the object-based approach that PageObjects encourage

Loadable Component
What Is It?
The LoadableComponent is a base class that aims to make writing PageObjects less painful. It does this by providing a standard way of ensuring that pages are loaded and providing hooks to make debugging the failure of a page to load easier. You can use it to help reduce the amount of boilerplate code in your tests, which in turn makes maintaining your tests less tiresome.

There is currently an implementation in Java that ships as part of Selenium 2, but the approach used is simple enough to be implemented in any language.

Simple Usage
As an example of a UI that we’d like to model, take a look at the new issue page. From the point of view of a test author, this offers the service of being able to file a new issue. A basic Page Object would look like:

package com.example.webdriver;

import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;

public class EditIssue {

  private final WebDriver driver;

  public EditIssue(WebDriver driver) {
    this.driver = driver;
  }

  public void setTitle(String title) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_title")));
    clearAndType(field, title);
  }

  public void setBody(String body) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_body"));
    clearAndType(field, body);
  }

  public void setHowToReproduce(String howToReproduce) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_repro-command"));
    clearAndType(field, howToReproduce);
  }

  public void setLogOutput(String logOutput) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_logs"));
    clearAndType(field, logOutput);
  }

  public void setOperatingSystem(String operatingSystem) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_operating-system"));
    clearAndType(field, operatingSystem);
  }

  public void setSeleniumVersion(String seleniumVersion) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_selenium-version"));
    clearAndType(field, logOutput);
  }

  public void setBrowserVersion(String browserVersion) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_browser-versions"));
    clearAndType(field, browserVersion);
  }

  public void setDriverVersion(String driverVersion) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_browser-driver-versions"));
    clearAndType(field, driverVersion);
  }

  public void setUsingGrid(String usingGrid) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_selenium-grid-version"));
    clearAndType(field, usingGrid);
  }

  public IssueList submit() {
    driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("button[type='submit']")).click();
    return new IssueList(driver);
  }

  private void clearAndType(WebElement field, String text) {
    field.clear();
    field.sendKeys(text);
  }
}
In order to turn this into a LoadableComponent, all we need to do is to set that as the base type:

public class EditIssue extends LoadableComponent<EditIssue> {
  // rest of class ignored for now
}
This signature looks a little unusual, but all it means is that this class represents a LoadableComponent that loads the EditIssue page.

By extending this base class, we need to implement two new methods:

  @Override
  protected void load() {
    driver.get("https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/new?assignees=&labels=I-defect%2Cneeds-triaging&projects=&template=bug-report.yml&title=%5B%F0%9F%90%9B+Bug%5D%3A+");
  }

  @Override
  protected void isLoaded() throws Error {
    String url = driver.getCurrentUrl();
    assertTrue("Not on the issue entry page: " + url, url.endsWith("/new"));
  }
The load method is used to navigate to the page, whilst the isLoaded method is used to determine whether we are on the right page. Although the method looks like it should return a boolean, instead it performs a series of assertions using JUnit’s Assert class. There can be as few or as many assertions as you like. By using these assertions it’s possible to give users of the class clear information that can be used to debug tests.

With a little rework, our PageObject looks like:

package com.example.webdriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.FindBy;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.PageFactory;

import static junit.framework.Assert.assertTrue;

public class EditIssue extends LoadableComponent<EditIssue> {

  private final WebDriver driver;
  
  // By default the PageFactory will locate elements with the same name or id
  // as the field. Since the issue_title element has an id attribute of "issue_title"
  // we don't need any additional annotations.
  private WebElement issue_title;
  
  // But we'd prefer a different name in our code than "issue_body", so we use the
  // FindBy annotation to tell the PageFactory how to locate the element.
  @FindBy(id = "issue_body") private WebElement body;
  
  public EditIssue(WebDriver driver) {
    this.driver = driver;
    
    // This call sets the WebElement fields.
    PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
  }

  @Override
  protected void load() {
    driver.get("https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/new?assignees=&labels=I-defect%2Cneeds-triaging&projects=&template=bug-report.yml&title=%5B%F0%9F%90%9B+Bug%5D%3A+");
  }

  @Override
  protected void isLoaded() throws Error {
    String url = driver.getCurrentUrl();
    assertTrue("Not on the issue entry page: " + url, url.endsWith("/new"));
  }

  public void setHowToReproduce(String howToReproduce) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_repro-command"));
    clearAndType(field, howToReproduce);
  }

  public void setLogOutput(String logOutput) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_logs"));
    clearAndType(field, logOutput);
  }

  public void setOperatingSystem(String operatingSystem) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_operating-system"));
    clearAndType(field, operatingSystem);
  }

  public void setSeleniumVersion(String seleniumVersion) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_selenium-version"));
    clearAndType(field, logOutput);
  }

  public void setBrowserVersion(String browserVersion) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_browser-versions"));
    clearAndType(field, browserVersion);
  }

  public void setDriverVersion(String driverVersion) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_browser-driver-versions"));
    clearAndType(field, driverVersion);
  }

  public void setUsingGrid(String usingGrid) {
    WebElement field = driver.findElement(By.id("issue_form_selenium-grid-version"));
    clearAndType(field, usingGrid);
  }

  public IssueList submit() {
    driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("button[type='submit']")).click();
    return new IssueList(driver);
  }

  private void clearAndType(WebElement field, String text) {
    field.clear();
    field.sendKeys(text);
  }
}
That doesn’t seem to have bought us much, right? One thing it has done is encapsulate the information about how to navigate to the page into the page itself, meaning that this information’s not scattered through the code base. It also means that we can do this in our tests:

EditIssue page = new EditIssue(driver).get();
This call will cause the driver to navigate to the page if that’s necessary.

Nested Components
LoadableComponents start to become more useful when they are used in conjunction with other LoadableComponents. Using our example, we could view the “edit issue” page as a component within a project’s website (after all, we access it via a tab on that site). You also need to be logged in to file an issue. We could model this as a tree of nested components:

 + ProjectPage
 +---+ SecuredPage
     +---+ EditIssue
What would this look like in code? For a start, each logical component would have its own class. The “load” method in each of them would “get” the parent. The end result, in addition to the EditIssue class above is:

ProjectPage.java:

package com.example.webdriver;

import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;

public class ProjectPage extends LoadableComponent<ProjectPage> {

  private final WebDriver driver;
  private final String projectName;

  public ProjectPage(WebDriver driver, String projectName) {
    this.driver = driver;
    this.projectName = projectName;
  }

  @Override
  protected void load() {
    driver.get("http://" + projectName + ".googlecode.com/");
  }

  @Override
  protected void isLoaded() throws Error {
    String url = driver.getCurrentUrl();

    assertTrue(url.contains(projectName));
  }
}
and SecuredPage.java:

package com.example.webdriver;

import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;

import static org.junit.Assert.fail;

public class SecuredPage extends LoadableComponent<SecuredPage> {

  private final WebDriver driver;
  private final LoadableComponent<?> parent;
  private final String username;
  private final String password;

  public SecuredPage(WebDriver driver, LoadableComponent<?> parent, String username, String password) {
    this.driver = driver;
    this.parent = parent;
    this.username = username;
    this.password = password;
  }

  @Override
  protected void load() {
    parent.get();

    String originalUrl = driver.getCurrentUrl();

    // Sign in
    driver.get("https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=code");
    driver.findElement(By.name("Email")).sendKeys(username);
    WebElement passwordField = driver.findElement(By.name("Passwd"));
    passwordField.sendKeys(password);
    passwordField.submit();

    // Now return to the original URL
    driver.get(originalUrl);
  }

  @Override
  protected void isLoaded() throws Error {
    // If you're signed in, you have the option of picking a different login.
    // Let's check for the presence of that.

    try {
      WebElement div = driver.findElement(By.id("multilogin-dropdown"));
    } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
      fail("Cannot locate user name link");
    }
  }
}
The “load” method in EditIssue now looks like:

  @Override
  protected void load() {
    securedPage.get();

    driver.get("https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/new?assignees=&labels=I-defect%2Cneeds-triaging&projects=&template=bug-report.yml&title=%5B%F0%9F%90%9B+Bug%5D%3A+");
  }
This shows that the components are all “nested” within each other. A call to get() in EditIssue will cause all its dependencies to load too. The example usage:

public class FooTest {
  private EditIssue editIssue;

  @Before
  public void prepareComponents() {
    WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();

    ProjectPage project = new ProjectPage(driver, "selenium");
    SecuredPage securedPage = new SecuredPage(driver, project, "example", "top secret");
    editIssue = new EditIssue(driver, securedPage);
  }

  @Test
  public void demonstrateNestedLoadableComponents() {
    editIssue.get();

    editIssue.title.sendKeys('Title');
    editIssue.body.sendKeys('What Happened');
    editIssue.setHowToReproduce('How to Reproduce');
    editIssue.setLogOutput('Log Output');
    editIssue.setOperatingSystem('Operating System');
    editIssue.setSeleniumVersion('Selenium Version');
    editIssue.setBrowserVersion('Browser Version');
    editIssue.setDriverVersion('Driver Version');
    editIssue.setUsingGrid('I Am Using Grid');
  }

}
If you’re using a library such as Guiceberry in your tests, the preamble of setting up the PageObjects can be omitted leading to nice, clear, readable tests.

Bot Pattern
(previously located: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Bot-Style-Tests)

Although PageObjects are a useful way of reducing duplication in your tests, it’s not always a pattern that teams feel comfortable following. An alternative approach is to follow a more “command-like” style of testing.

A “bot” is an action-oriented abstraction over the raw Selenium APIs. This means that if you find that commands aren’t doing the Right Thing for your app, it’s easy to change them. As an example:

public class ActionBot {
  private final WebDriver driver;

  public ActionBot(WebDriver driver) {
    this.driver = driver;
  }

  public void click(By locator) {
    driver.findElement(locator).click();
  }

  public void submit(By locator) {
    driver.findElement(locator).submit();
  }

  /** 
   * Type something into an input field. WebDriver doesn't normally clear these
   * before typing, so this method does that first. It also sends a return key
   * to move the focus out of the element.
   */
  public void type(By locator, String text) { 
    WebElement element = driver.findElement(locator);
    element.clear();
    element.sendKeys(text + "\n");
  }
}
Once these abstractions have been built and duplication in your tests identified, it’s possible to layer PageObjects on top of bots.

Overview of Test Automation
First, start by asking yourself whether or not you really need to use a browser. Odds are that, at some point, if you are working on a complex web application, you will need to open a browser and actually test it.

Functional end-user tests such as Selenium tests are expensive to run, however. Furthermore, they typically require substantial infrastructure to be in place to be run effectively. It is a good rule to always ask yourself if what you want to test can be done using more lightweight test approaches such as unit tests or with a lower-level approach.

Once you have made the determination that you are in the web browser testing business, and you have your Selenium environment ready to begin writing tests, you will generally perform some combination of three steps:

Set up the data
Perform a discrete set of actions
Evaluate the results
You will want to keep these steps as short as possible; one or two operations should be enough most of the time. Browser automation has the reputation of being “flaky”, but in reality, that is because users frequently demand too much of it. In later chapters, we will return to techniques you can use to mitigate apparent intermittent problems in tests, in particular on how to overcome race conditions between the browser and WebDriver.

By keeping your tests short and using the web browser only when you have absolutely no alternative, you can have many tests with minimal flake.

A distinct advantage of Selenium tests is their inherent ability to test all components of the application, from backend to frontend, from a user’s perspective. So in other words, whilst functional tests may be expensive to run, they also encompass large business-critical portions at one time.

Testing requirements
As mentioned before, Selenium tests can be expensive to run. To what extent depends on the browser you are running the tests against, but historically browsers’ behaviour has varied so much that it has often been a stated goal to cross-test against multiple browsers.

Selenium allows you to run the same instructions against multiple browsers on multiple operating systems, but the enumeration of all the possible browsers, their different versions, and the many operating systems they run on will quickly become a non-trivial undertaking.

Let’s start with an example
Larry has written a web site which allows users to order their custom unicorns.

The general workflow (what we will call the “happy path”) is something like this:

Create an account
Configure the unicorn
Add it to the shopping cart
Check out and pay
Give feedback about the unicorn
It would be tempting to write one grand Selenium script to perform all these operations–many will try. Resist the temptation! Doing so will result in a test that a) takes a long time, b) will be subject to some common issues around page rendering timing issues, and c) is such that if it fails, it will not give you a concise, “glanceable” method for diagnosing what went wrong.

The preferred strategy for testing this scenario would be to break it down to a series of independent, speedy tests, each of which has one “reason” to exist.

Let us pretend you want to test the second step: Configuring your unicorn. It will perform the following actions:

Create an account
Configure a unicorn
Note that we are skipping the rest of these steps, we will test the rest of the workflow in other small, discrete test cases after we are done with this one.

To start, you need to create an account. Here you have some choices to make:

Do you want to use an existing account?
Do you want to create a new account?
Are there any special properties of such a user that need to be taken into account before configuration begins?
Regardless of how you answer this question, the solution is to make it part of the “set up the data” portion of the test. If Larry has exposed an API that enables you (or anyone) to create and update user accounts, be sure to use that to answer this question. If possible, you want to launch the browser only after you have a user “in hand”, whose credentials you can just log in with.

If each test for each workflow begins with the creation of a user account, many seconds will be added to the execution of each test. Calling an API and talking to a database are quick, “headless” operations that don’t require the expensive process of opening a browser, navigating to the right pages, clicking and waiting for the forms to be submitted, etc.

Ideally, you can address this set-up phase in one line of code, which will execute before any browser is launched:

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
# Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn,
# but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have
# administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email
# address and password are randomly generated--you don't even need to
# know them.
user = user_factory.create_common_user() #This method is defined elsewhere.

# Log in as this user.
# Logging in on this site takes you to your personal "My Account" page, so the
# AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then
# perform actions from the AccountPage.
account_page = login_as(user.get_email(), user.get_password())
  
As you can imagine, the UserFactory can be extended to provide methods such as createAdminUser(), and createUserWithPayment(). The point is, these two lines of code do not distract you from the ultimate purpose of this test: configuring a unicorn.

The intricacies of the Page Object model will be discussed in later chapters, but we will introduce the concept here:

Your tests should be composed of actions, performed from the user’s point of view, within the context of pages in the site. These pages are stored as objects, which will contain specific information about how the web page is composed and how actions are performed– very little of which should concern you as a tester.

What kind of unicorn do you want? You might want pink, but not necessarily. Purple has been quite popular lately. Does she need sunglasses? Star tattoos? These choices, while difficult, are your primary concern as a tester– you need to ensure that your order fulfillment center sends out the right unicorn to the right person, and that starts with these choices.

Notice that nowhere in that paragraph do we talk about buttons, fields, drop-downs, radio buttons, or web forms. Neither should your tests! You want to write your code like the user trying to solve their problem. Here is one way of doing this (continuing from the previous example):

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
# The Unicorn is a top-level Object--it has attributes, which are set here.
# This only stores the values; it does not fill out any web forms or interact
# with the browser in any way.
sparkles = Unicorn("Sparkles", UnicornColors.PURPLE, UnicornAccessories.SUNGLASSES, UnicornAdornments.STAR_TATTOOS)

# Since we're already "on" the account page, we have to use it to get to the
# actual place where you configure unicorns. Calling the "Add Unicorn" method
# takes us there.
add_unicorn_page = account_page.add_unicorn()

# Now that we're on the AddUnicornPage, we will pass the "sparkles" object to
# its createUnicorn() method. This method will take Sparkles' attributes,
# fill out the form, and click submit.
unicorn_confirmation_page = add_unicorn_page.create_unicorn(sparkles)
  
Now that you have configured your unicorn, you need to move on to step 3: making sure it actually worked.

Java
Python
CSharp
Ruby
JavaScript
Kotlin
# The exists() method from UnicornConfirmationPage will take the Sparkles
# object--a specification of the attributes you want to see, and compare
# them with the fields on the page.
assert unicorn_confirmation_page.exists(sparkles), "Sparkles should have been created, with all attributes intact"
  
Note that the tester still has not done anything but talk about unicorns in this code– no buttons, no locators, no browser controls. This method of modelling the application allows you to keep these test-level commands in place and unchanging, even if Larry decides next week that he no longer likes Ruby-on-Rails and decides to re-implement the entire site in the latest Haskell bindings with a Fortran front-end.

Your page objects will require some small maintenance in order to conform to the site redesign, but these tests will remain the same. Taking this basic design, you will want to keep going through your workflows with the fewest browser-facing steps possible. Your next workflow will involve adding a unicorn to the shopping cart. You will probably want many iterations of this test in order to make sure the cart is keeping its state properly: Is there more than one unicorn in the cart before you start? How many can fit in the shopping cart? If you create more than one with the same name and/or features, will it break? Will it only keep the existing one or will it add another?

Each time you move through the workflow, you want to try to avoid having to create an account, login as the user, and configure the unicorn. Ideally, you will be able to create an account and pre-configure a unicorn via the API or database. Then all you have to do is log in as the user, locate Sparkles, and add her to the cart.

To automate or not to automate?
Is automation always advantageous? When should one decide to automate test cases?

It is not always advantageous to automate test cases. There are times when manual testing may be more appropriate. For instance, if the application’s user interface will change considerably in the near future, then any automation might need to be rewritten anyway. Also, sometimes there simply is not enough time to build test automation. For the short term, manual testing may be more effective. If an application has a very tight deadline, there is currently no test automation available, and it’s imperative that the testing gets done within that time frame, then manual testing is the best solution.

Types of Testing
Acceptance testing
This type of testing is done to determine if a feature or system meets the customer expectations and requirements. This type of testing generally involves the customer’s cooperation or feedback, being a validation activity that answers the question:

Are we building the right product?

For web applications, the automation of this testing can be done directly with Selenium by simulating user expected behaviour. This simulation could be done by record/playback or through the different supported languages as explained in this documentation. Note: Acceptance testing is a subtype of functional testing, which some people might also refer to.

Functional testing
This type of testing is done to determine if a feature or system functions properly without issues. It checks the system at different levels to ensure that all scenarios are covered and that the system does what it’s supposed to do. It’s a verification activity that answers the question:

Are we building the product right?

This generally includes: the tests work without errors (404, exceptions…), in a usable way (correct redirections),
in an accessible way and matching its specifications (see acceptance testing above).

For web applications, the automation of this testing can be done directly with Selenium by simulating expected returns.
This simulation could be done by record/playback or through the different supported languages as explained in this documentation.

Integration Tests
Integration tests verify the interactions between different components or modules of a system. Several modules are together tested. The purpose of Integration tests is to make sure that all modules integrate and work together as expected. Automated integration tests help ensure that these interactions work as expected and that integrated components function properly together.

For example, Testing the flow of placing the order for an item in an ecommerce website along with payment.

System Tests
System Testing is a complete fully integrated product Testing. It is an end-to-end testing where in testing environment is similar to the production environment. Here, we navigate through all the features of the software and test if the end business / end feature works. We just test the end feature and don’t check for data flow or do functional testing and all.

For example, Testing the end to end flow from login to placing an order and rechecking the order in My Orders page and logoff from an ecommerce website.

Performance testing
As its name indicates, performance tests are done to measure how well an application is performing.

There are two main sub-types for performance testing:

Load testing
Load testing is done to verify how well the application works under different defined loads (usually a particular number of users connected at once).

Stress testing
Stress testing is done to verify how well the application works under stress (or above the maximum supported load).

Generally, performance tests are done by executing some Selenium written tests simulating different users hitting a particular function on the web app and retrieving some meaningful measurements.

This is generally done by other tools that retrieve the metrics. One such tool is JMeter.

For a web application, details to measure include throughput, latency, data loss, individual component loading times, etc.

Note 1: All browsers have a performance tab in their developers’ tools section (accessible by pressing F12)

Note 2: is a subtype of non-functional testing as this is generally measured per system and not per function/feature.

Regression testing
This testing is generally done after a change, fix or feature addition.

To ensure that the change has not broken any of the existing functionality, some already executed tests are executed again.

The set of re-executed tests can be full or partial and can include several different types, depending on the application and development team.

Test driven development (TDD)
Rather than a test type per se, TDD is an iterative development methodology in which tests drive the design of a feature.

Each cycle starts by creating a set of unit tests that the feature should eventually pass (they should fail their first time executed).

After this, development takes place to make the tests pass. The tests are executed again, starting another cycle and this process continues until all tests are passing.

This aims to speed up the development of an application based on the fact that defects are less costly the earlier they are found.

Behavior-driven development (BDD)
BDD is also an iterative development methodology based on the above TDD, in which the goal is to involve all the parties in the development of an application.

Each cycle starts by creating some specifications (which should fail). Then create the failing unit tests (which should also fail) and then do the development.

This cycle is repeated until all types of tests are passing.

In order to do so, a specification language is used. It should be understandable by all parties and simple, standard and explicit. Most tools use Gherkin as this language.

The goal is to be able to detect even more errors than TDD, by targeting potential acceptance errors too and make communication between parties smoother.

A set of tools are currently available to write the specifications and match them with code functions, such as Cucumber or SpecFlow.

A set of tools are built on top of Selenium to make this process even faster by directly transforming the BDD specifications into executable code. Some of these are JBehave, Capybara and Robot Framework.

A note on “Best Practices”: We’ve intentionally avoided the phrase “Best Practices” in this documentation. No one approach works for all situations. We prefer the idea of “Guidelines and Recommendations”. We encourage you to read through these and thoughtfully decide what approaches will work for you in your particular environment.

Functional testing is difficult to get right for many reasons. As if application state, complexity, and dependencies do not make testing difficult enough, dealing with browsers (especially with cross-browser incompatibilities) makes writing good tests a challenge.

Selenium provides tools to make functional user interaction easier, but does not help you write well-architected test suites. In this chapter we offer advice, guidelines, and recommendations on how to approach functional web page automation.

This chapter records software design patterns popular amongst many of the users of Selenium that have proven successful over the years.

Page object models
v4.0
Page object models
Note: this page has merged contents from multiple sources, including the Selenium wiki

Overview
Within your web app’s UI, there are areas where your tests interact with. A Page Object only models these as objects within the test code. This reduces the amount of duplicated code and means that if the UI changes, the fix needs only to be applied in one place.

Page Object is a Design Pattern that has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT. The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with the UI of that page. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves don’t need to change, only the code within the page object needs to change. Subsequently, all changes to support that new UI are located in one place.

Advantages
There is a clean separation between the test code and page-specific code, such as locators (or their use if you’re using a UI Map) and layout.
There is a single repository for the services or operations the page offers rather than having these services scattered throughout the tests.
In both cases, this allows any modifications required due to UI changes to all be made in one place. Helpful information on this technique can be found on numerous blogs as this ‘test design pattern’ is becoming widely used. We encourage readers who wish to know more to search the internet for blogs on this subject. Many have written on this design pattern and can provide helpful tips beyond the scope of this user guide. To get you started, we’ll illustrate page objects with a simple example.

Examples
First, consider an example, typical of test automation, that does not use a page object:

/***
 * Tests login feature
 */
public class Login {

  public void testLogin() {
    // fill login data on sign-in page
    driver.findElement(By.name("user_name")).sendKeys("userName");
    driver.findElement(By.name("password")).sendKeys("my supersecret password");
    driver.findElement(By.name("sign-in")).click();

    // verify h1 tag is "Hello userName" after login
    driver.findElement(By.tagName("h1")).isDisplayed();
    assertThat(driver.findElement(By.tagName("h1")).getText(), is("Hello userName"));
  }
}
There are two problems with this approach.

There is no separation between the test method and the AUT’s locators (IDs in this example); both are intertwined in a single method. If the AUT’s UI changes its identifiers, layout, or how a login is input and processed, the test itself must change.
The ID-locators would be spread in multiple tests, in all tests that had to use this login page.
Applying the page object techniques, this example could be rewritten like this in the following example of a page object for a Sign-in page.

import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;

/**
 * Page Object encapsulates the Sign-in page.
 */
public class SignInPage {
  protected WebDriver driver;

  // <input name="user_name" type="text" value="">
  private By usernameBy = By.name("user_name");
  // <input name="password" type="password" value="">
  private By passwordBy = By.name("password");
  // <input name="sign_in" type="submit" value="SignIn">
  private By signinBy = By.name("sign_in");

  public SignInPage(WebDriver driver){
    this.driver = driver;
     if (!driver.getTitle().equals("Sign In Page")) {
      throw new IllegalStateException("This is not Sign In Page," +
            " current page is: " + driver.getCurrentUrl());
    }
  }

  /**
    * Login as valid user
    *
    * @param userName
    * @param password
    * @return HomePage object
    */
  public HomePage loginValidUser(String userName, String password) {
    driver.findElement(usernameBy).sendKeys(userName);
    driver.findElement(passwordBy).sendKeys(password);
    driver.findElement(signinBy).click();
    return new HomePage(driver);
  }
}
and page object for a Home page could look like this.

import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;

/**
 * Page Object encapsulates the Home Page
 */
public class HomePage {
  protected WebDriver driver;

  // <h1>Hello userName</h1>
  private By messageBy = By.tagName("h1");

  public HomePage(WebDriver driver){
    this.driver = driver;
    if (!driver.getTitle().equals("Home Page of logged in user")) {
      throw new IllegalStateException("This is not Home Page of logged in user," +
            " current page is: " + driver.getCurrentUrl());
    }
  }

  /**
    * Get message (h1 tag)
    *
    * @return String message text
    */
  public String getMessageText() {
    return driver.findElement(messageBy).getText();
  }

  public HomePage manageProfile() {
    // Page encapsulation to manage profile functionality
    return new HomePage(driver);
  }
  /* More methods offering the services represented by Home Page
  of Logged User. These methods in turn might return more Page Objects
  for example click on Compose mail button could return ComposeMail class object */
}
So now, the login test would use these two page objects as follows.

/***
 * Tests login feature
 */
public class TestLogin {

  @Test
  public void testLogin() {
    SignInPage signInPage = new SignInPage(driver);
    HomePage homePage = signInPage.loginValidUser("userName", "password");
    assertThat(homePage.getMessageText(), is("Hello userName"));
  }

}
There is a lot of flexibility in how the page objects may be designed, but there are a few basic rules for getting the desired maintainability of your test code.

Assertions in Page Objects
Page objects themselves should never make verifications or assertions. This is part of your test and should always be within the test’s code, never in a page object. The page object will contain the representation of the page, and the services the page provides via methods but no code related to what is being tested should be within the page object.

There is one, single, verification which can, and should, be within the page object and that is to verify that the page, and possibly critical elements on the page, were loaded correctly. This verification should be done while instantiating the page object. In the examples above, both the SignInPage and HomePage constructors check that the expected page is available and ready for requests from the test.

Page Component Objects
A page object does not necessarily need to represent all the parts of a page itself. This was noted by Martin Fowler in the early days, while first coining the term “panel objects”.

The same principles used for page objects can be used to create “Page Component Objects”, as it was later called, that represent discrete chunks of the page and can be included in page objects. These component objects can provide references to the elements inside those discrete chunks, and methods to leverage the functionality or behavior provided by them.

For example, a Products page has multiple products.

<!-- Products Page -->
<div class="header_container">
    <span class="title">Products</span>
</div>

<div class="inventory_list">
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
</div>
Each product is a component of the Products page.

<!-- Inventory Item -->
<div class="inventory_item">
    <div class="inventory_item_name">Backpack</div>
    <div class="pricebar">
        <div class="inventory_item_price">$29.99</div>
        <button id="add-to-cart-backpack">Add to cart</button>
    </div>
</div>
The Products page HAS-A list of products. This object relationship is called Composition. In simpler terms, something is composed of another thing.

public abstract class BasePage {
    protected WebDriver driver;

    public BasePage(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }
}

// Page Object
public class ProductsPage extends BasePage {
    public ProductsPage(WebDriver driver) {
        super(driver);
        // No assertions, throws an exception if the element is not loaded
        new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(3))
            .until(d -> d.findElement(By.className​("header_container")));
    }

    // Returning a list of products is a service of the page
    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        return driver.findElements(By.className​("inventory_item"))
            .stream()
            .map(e -> new Product(e)) // Map WebElement to a product component
            .toList();
    }

    // Return a specific product using a boolean-valued function (predicate)
    // This is the behavioral Strategy Pattern from GoF
    public Product getProduct(Predicate<Product> condition) {
        return getProducts()
            .stream()
            .filter(condition) // Filter by product name or price
            .findFirst()
            .orElseThrow();
    }
}
The Product component object is used inside the Products page object.

public abstract class BaseComponent {
    protected WebElement root;

    public BaseComponent(WebElement root) {
        this.root = root;
    }
}

// Page Component Object
public class Product extends BaseComponent {
    // The root element contains the entire component
    public Product(WebElement root) {
        super(root); // inventory_item
    }

    public String getName() {
        // Locating an element begins at the root of the component
        return root.findElement(By.className("inventory_item_name")).getText();
    }

    public BigDecimal getPrice() {
        return new BigDecimal(
                root.findElement(By.className("inventory_item_price"))
                    .getText()
                    .replace("$", "")
            ).setScale(2, RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY); // Sanitation and formatting
    }

    public void addToCart() {
        root.findElement(By.id("add-to-cart-backpack")).click();
    }
}
So now, the products test would use the page object and the page component object as follows.

public class ProductsTest {
    @Test
    public void testProductInventory() {
        var productsPage = new ProductsPage(driver); // page object
        var products = productsPage.getProducts();
        assertEquals(6, products.size()); // expected, actual
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testProductPrices() {
        var productsPage = new ProductsPage(driver);

        // Pass a lambda expression (predicate) to filter the list of products
        // The predicate or "strategy" is the behavior passed as parameter
        var backpack = productsPage.getProduct(p -> p.getName().equals("Backpack")); // page component object
        var bikeLight = productsPage.getProduct(p -> p.getName().equals("Bike Light"));

        assertEquals(new BigDecimal("29.99"), backpack.getPrice());
        assertEquals(new BigDecimal("9.99"), bikeLight.getPrice());
    }
}
The page and component are represented by their own objects. Both objects only have methods for the services they offer, which matches the real-world application in object-oriented programming.

You can even nest component objects inside other component objects for more complex pages. If a page in the AUT has multiple components, or common components used throughout the site (e.g. a navigation bar), then it may improve maintainability and reduce code duplication.

Other Design Patterns Used in Testing
There are other design patterns that also may be used in testing. Discussing all of these is beyond the scope of this user guide. Here, we merely want to introduce the concepts to make the reader aware of some of the things that can be done. As was mentioned earlier, many have blogged on this topic and we encourage the reader to search for blogs on these topics.

Implementation Notes
PageObjects can be thought of as facing in two directions simultaneously. Facing toward the developer of a test, they represent the services offered by a particular page. Facing away from the developer, they should be the only thing that has a deep knowledge of the structure of the HTML of a page (or part of a page) It’s simplest to think of the methods on a Page Object as offering the “services” that a page offers rather than exposing the details and mechanics of the page. As an example, think of the inbox of any web-based email system. Amongst the services it offers are the ability to compose a new email, choose to read a single email, and list the subject lines of the emails in the inbox. How these are implemented shouldn’t matter to the test.

Because we’re encouraging the developer of a test to try and think about the services they’re interacting with rather than the implementation, PageObjects should seldom expose the underlying WebDriver instance. To facilitate this, methods on the PageObject should return other PageObjects. This means we can effectively model the user’s journey through our application. It also means that should the way that pages relate to one another change (like when the login page asks the user to change their password the first time they log into a service when it previously didn’t do that), simply changing the appropriate method’s signature will cause the tests to fail to compile. Put another way; we can tell which tests would fail without needing to run them when we change the relationship between pages and reflect this in the PageObjects.

One consequence of this approach is that it may be necessary to model (for example) both a successful and unsuccessful login; or a click could have a different result depending on the app’s state. When this happens, it is common to have multiple methods on the PageObject:

public class LoginPage {
    public HomePage loginAs(String username, String password) {
        // ... clever magic happens here
    }
    
    public LoginPage loginAsExpectingError(String username, String password) {
        //  ... failed login here, maybe because one or both of the username and password are wrong
    }
    
    public String getErrorMessage() {
        // So we can verify that the correct error is shown
    }
}
The code presented above shows an important point: the tests, not the PageObjects, should be responsible for making assertions about the state of a page. For example:

public void testMessagesAreReadOrUnread() {
    Inbox inbox = new Inbox(driver);
    inbox.assertMessageWithSubjectIsUnread("I like cheese");
    inbox.assertMessageWithSubjectIsNotUnread("I'm not fond of tofu");
}
could be re-written as:

public void testMessagesAreReadOrUnread() {
    Inbox inbox = new Inbox(driver);
    assertTrue(inbox.isMessageWithSubjectIsUnread("I like cheese"));
    assertFalse(inbox.isMessageWithSubjectIsUnread("I'm not fond of tofu"));
}
Of course, as with every guideline, there are exceptions, and one that is commonly seen with PageObjects is to check that the WebDriver is on the correct page when we instantiate the PageObject. This is done in the example below.

Finally, a PageObject need not represent an entire page. It may represent a section that appears frequently within a site or page, such as site navigation. The essential principle is that there is only one place in your test suite with knowledge of the structure of the HTML of a particular (part of a) page.

Summary
The public methods represent the services that the page offers
Try not to expose the internals of the page
Generally don’t make assertions
Methods return other PageObjects
Need not represent an entire page
Different results for the same action are modelled as different methods
Example
public class LoginPage {
    private final WebDriver driver;

    public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;

        // Check that we're on the right page.
        if (!"Login".equals(driver.getTitle())) {
            // Alternatively, we could navigate to the login page, perhaps logging out first
            throw new IllegalStateException("This is not the login page");
        }
    }

    // The login page contains several HTML elements that will be represented as WebElements.
    // The locators for these elements should only be defined once.
        By usernameLocator = By.id("username");
        By passwordLocator = By.id("passwd");
        By loginButtonLocator = By.id("login");

    // The login page allows the user to type their username into the username field
    public LoginPage typeUsername(String username) {
        // This is the only place that "knows" how to enter a username
        driver.findElement(usernameLocator).sendKeys(username);

        // Return the current page object as this action doesn't navigate to a page represented by another PageObject
        return this;	
    }

    // The login page allows the user to type their password into the password field
    public LoginPage typePassword(String password) {
        // This is the only place that "knows" how to enter a password
        driver.findElement(passwordLocator).sendKeys(password);

        // Return the current page object as this action doesn't navigate to a page represented by another PageObject
        return this;	
    }

    // The login page allows the user to submit the login form
    public HomePage submitLogin() {
        // This is the only place that submits the login form and expects the destination to be the home page.
        // A seperate method should be created for the instance of clicking login whilst expecting a login failure. 
        driver.findElement(loginButtonLocator).submit();

        // Return a new page object representing the destination. Should the login page ever
        // go somewhere else (for example, a legal disclaimer) then changing the method signature
        // for this method will mean that all tests that rely on this behaviour won't compile.
        return new HomePage(driver);	
    }

    // The login page allows the user to submit the login form knowing that an invalid username and / or password were entered
    public LoginPage submitLoginExpectingFailure() {
        // This is the only place that submits the login form and expects the destination to be the login page due to login failure.
        driver.findElement(loginButtonLocator).submit();

        // Return a new page object representing the destination. Should the user ever be navigated to the home page after submiting a login with credentials 
        // expected to fail login, the script will fail when it attempts to instantiate the LoginPage PageObject.
        return new LoginPage(driver);	
    }

    // Conceptually, the login page offers the user the service of being able to "log into"
    // the application using a user name and password. 
    public HomePage loginAs(String username, String password) {
        // The PageObject methods that enter username, password & submit login have already defined and should not be repeated here.
        typeUsername(username);
        typePassword(password);
        return submitLogin();
    }

Domain specific language
v4.0
Domain specific language
A domain specific language (DSL) is a system which provides the user with an expressive means of solving a problem. It allows a user to interact with the system on their terms – not just programmer-speak.

Your users, in general, do not care how your site looks. They do not care about the decoration, animations, or graphics. They want to use your system to push their new employees through the process with minimal difficulty; they want to book travel to Alaska; they want to configure and buy unicorns at a discount. Your job as tester is to come as close as you can to “capturing” this mind-set. With that in mind, we set about “modeling” the application you are working on, such that the test scripts (the user’s only pre-release proxy) “speak” for, and represent the user.

The goal is to use ubiquitous language. Rather than referring to “load data into this table” or “click on the third column” it should be possible to use language such as “create a new account” or “order displayed results by name”

With Selenium, DSL is usually represented by methods, written to make the API simple and readable – they enable a report between the developers and the stakeholders (users, product owners, business intelligence specialists, etc.).

Benefits
Readable: Business stakeholders can understand it.
Writable: Easy to write, avoids unnecessary duplication.
Extensible: Functionality can (reasonably) be added without breaking contracts and existing functionality.
Maintainable: By leaving the implementation details out of test cases, you are well-insulated against changes to the AUT*.
Further Reading
(previously located: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Domain-Driven-Design)

There is a good book on Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321125215/domainlanguag-20

And to whet your appetite there’s a useful smaller book available online for download at http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly

Java
Here is an example of a reasonable DSL method in Java. For brevity’s sake, it assumes the driver object is pre-defined and available to the method.

/**
 * Takes a username and password, fills out the fields, and clicks "login".
 * @return An instance of the AccountPage
 */
public AccountPage loginAsUser(String username, String password) {
  WebElement loginField = driver.findElement(By.id("loginField"));
  loginField.clear();
  loginField.sendKeys(username);

  // Fill out the password field. The locator we're using is "By.id", and we should
  // have it defined elsewhere in the class.
  WebElement passwordField = driver.findElement(By.id("password"));
  passwordField.clear();
  passwordField.sendKeys(password);

  // Click the login button, which happens to have the id "submit".
  driver.findElement(By.id("submit")).click();

  // Create and return a new instance of the AccountPage (via the built-in Selenium
  // PageFactory).
  return PageFactory.newInstance(AccountPage.class);
}
This method completely abstracts the concepts of input fields, buttons, clicking, and even pages from your test code. Using this approach, all a tester has to do is call this method. This gives you a maintenance advantage: if the login fields ever changed, you would only ever have to change this method - not your tests.

public void loginTest() {
    loginAsUser("cbrown", "cl0wn3");

    // Now that we're logged in, do some other stuff--since we used a DSL to support
    // our testers, it's as easy as choosing from available methods.
    do.something();
    do.somethingElse();
    Assert.assertTrue("Something should have been done!", something.wasDone());

    // Note that we still haven't referred to a button or web control anywhere in this
    // script...
}
It bears repeating: one of your primary goals should be writing an API that allows your tests to address the problem at hand, and NOT the problem of the UI. The UI is a secondary concern for your users – they do not care about the UI, they just want to get their job done. Your test scripts should read like a laundry list of things the user wants to DO, and the things they want to KNOW. The tests should not concern themselves with HOW the UI requires you to go about it.

Generating application state
Selenium should not be used to prepare a test case. All repetitive actions and preparations for a test case, should be done through other methods. For example, most web UIs have authentication (e.g. a login form). Eliminating logging in via web browser before every test will improve both the speed and stability of the test. A method should be created to gain access to the AUT* (e.g. using an API to login and set a cookie). Also, creating methods to pre-load data for testing should not be done using Selenium. As mentioned previously, existing APIs should be leveraged to create data for the AUT*.

Improved reporting
Selenium is not designed to report on the status of test cases run. Taking advantage of the built-in reporting capabilities of unit test frameworks is a good start. Most unit test frameworks have reports that can generate xUnit or HTML formatted reports. xUnit reports are popular for importing results to a Continuous Integration (CI) server like Jenkins, Travis, Bamboo, etc. Here are some links for more information regarding report outputs for several languages.

Getting Test Results in TeamCity
xUnit.net 1.1 added support for JetBrains’ TeamCity. This support is automatically enabled, and requires no end-user configuration.

You can either use a TeamCity plugin, or use an external build runner (like MSBuild) when building your project in TeamCity.

Using the plugin
Download and install the plugin as per Teamcity documentation.

Select the xUnit runner for the build step, then select the version of xUnit your tests are written in, and finally a pattern to match your test binaries. Wildcards are supported, such as **/*.Tests.dll.

Using an external runner
Select the appropriate runner to add calls to the MSBuild task, the Console runner, or the .NET Core runner. You cannot use TeamCity’s SLN builder, because your SLN file does not have any references to running xUnit.net.

The runners in xUnit.net detect TeamCity is running through environment variables (specifically, it looks for TEAMCITY_PROJECT_NAME). If for some reason your build environment does not pass the TeamCity environment variables through to the runner, you can force TeamCity mode manually; on the console or DNX runner, add the -teamcity switch; on the MSBuild runner, add the property Reporter="teamcity" to your <xunit> task.

Using dotnet test
If you are running your tests with dotnet test, by default the messages that TeamCity consumes will be hidden by VSTest, because of the default verbosity level.

In order to ensure that the TeamCity control messages show up, add --logger "console;verbosity=detailed" to your dotnet test command line.

You can test this locally by doing the following:

Set environment variable TEAMCITY_PROJECT_NAME to any value
Run your tests with dotnet test <projectname> --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
You should see output lines that start with ##teamcity, similar to:

[xUnit.net 00:00:00.10] ##teamcity[flowStarted timestamp='2023-06-18T00:02:48.362+0000' flowId='my.tests.dll']

Getting Test Results in CruiseControl.NET
If you’re using CruiseControl.NET for continuous integration services, you can see the unit test results for xUnit.net on the build summary page.

To install support for CCnet
Configure the xUnit.net MSBuild task to output with the Xml= attribute, as shown below:
<Project DefaultTargets="Test">

  <UsingTask
    AssemblyFile="xunit.runner.msbuild.dll"
    TaskName="Xunit.Runner.MSBuild.xunit"/>

  <Target Name="Test">
    <xunit
        Assemblies="test.xunit\bin\Debug\test.xunit.dll"
        Xml="test.xunit.dll.xml"/>
  </Target>

</Project>
Edit your CCnet build task (in C:\Program Files\CruiseControl.NET\server\ccnet.config) to merge your XML files into the CCnet build output, as shown below:
  <project>
    <name>MyProject</name>
    [...]
    <publishers>
      <merge>
        <files>
          <file>D:\Builds\MyProject\Test.*.xml</file>
        </files>
      </merge>
      <xmllogger />
      <statistics />
    </publishers>
    [...]
  </project>
Download the xUnitSummary.xsl file and save it to C:\Program Files\CruiseControl.NET\webdashboard\xsl
Edit C:\Program Files\CruiseControl.NET\webdashboard\dashboard.config and add a line for the summary, as shown below (highlighted in yellow):


Reset the IIS server that’s running CCnet
Force a build and see the results! They should look similar to the following:


Copyright © 2025 .NET Foundation. Contributions welcomed at https://github.com/xunit/xunit/tree/gh-pages.

Getting Test Results in Azure DevOps Pipelines
Referencing the Visual Studio test runner
Using NuGet Package Manager (or Package Manager Console), add xunit.runner.visualstudio to at least one of your test projects. install-package xunit.runner.visualstudio
Configure Azure DevOps
Add a build step of type Visual Studio Test.
These instructions are written for Version 2.* of the Visual Studio Test task.

Locate test assemblies
Under Test selection/Test files, point to your generated test assemblies, for example:
**\bin\$(BuildConfiguration)\**\*.tests.dll
!**\obj\**
!**\ref\**
Note: it is important to make sure the file matching pattern is valid. You may need to add additional exclusions if your chosen name pattern unintentionally matches other files in your output folder(s). testVerAssemblyVer2 must be expressed with newlines. vsts-doc issue 1580

Enable Code Coverage (optional)
Select the Execution Options/Code Coverage Enabled checkbox.
Add /InIsolation under Execution options/Other console options. (This will suppress a warning otherwise generated.)
Viewing the results
After a successful build, the test results are available on the main view of the build. It should look something like this:



Comments
You no longer need to manually configure the test adapter path, because NuGet restored test adapters are automatically searched for.

Sometimes you get this error one or many times Warning: System.AppDomainUnloadedException: Attempted to access an unloaded AppDomain. This can happen if the test(s) started a thread but did not stop it. Make sure that all the threads started by the test(s) are stopped before completion. It is not related to Azure DevOps and does not affect the results. For more information, see xUnit Issue 490 and MS Connect.

Avoid sharing state
Although mentioned in several places, it is worth mentioning again. We must ensure that the tests are isolated from one another.

Do not share test data. Imagine several tests that each query the database for valid orders before picking one to perform an action on. Should two tests pick up the same order you are likely to get unexpected behavior.

Clean up stale data in the application that might be picked up by another test e.g. invalid order records.

Create a new WebDriver instance per test. This helps ensure test isolation and makes parallelization simpler.

If you choose pytest as your test runner, this can be easily done by yielding your driver in a global fixture. This way each test gets its own driver instance, and you can ensure that drivers always quit after a test is finished (pass or fail).

Tips on working with locators
When to use which locators and how best to manage them in your code.
Take a look at examples of the supported locator strategies.

In general, if HTML IDs are available, unique, and consistently predictable, they are the preferred method for locating an element on a page. They tend to work very quickly, and forego much processing that comes with complicated DOM traversals.

If unique IDs are unavailable, a well-written CSS selector is the preferred method of locating an element. XPath works as well as CSS selectors, but the syntax is complicated and frequently difficult to debug. Though XPath selectors are very flexible, they are typically not performance tested by browser vendors and tend to be quite slow.

Selection strategies based on linkText and partialLinkText have drawbacks in that they only work on link elements. Additionally, they call down to querySelectorAll selectors internally in WebDriver.

Tag name can be a dangerous way to locate elements. There are frequently multiple elements of the same tag present on the page. This is mostly useful when calling the findElements(By) method which returns a collection of elements.

The recommendation is to keep your locators as compact and readable as possible. Asking WebDriver to traverse the DOM structure is an expensive operation, and the more you can narrow the scope of your search, the better.

Test independency
v4.0
Test independency
Write each test as its own unit. Write the tests in a way that will not be reliant on other tests to complete:

Let us say there is a content management system with which you can create some custom content which then appears on your website as a module after publishing, and it may take some time to sync between the CMS and the application.

A wrong way of testing your module is that the content is created and published in one test, and then checking the module in another test. This is not feasible as the content may not be available immediately for the other test after publishing.

Instead, you can create a stub content which can be turned on and off within the affected test, and use that for validating the module. However, for content creation, you can still have a separate test.

Consider using a fluent API
Martin Fowler coined the term “Fluent API”. Selenium already implements something like this in their FluentWait class, which is meant as an alternative to the standard Wait class. You could enable the Fluent API design pattern in your page object and then query the Google search page with a code snippet like this one:

driver.get( "http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ww" );
GoogleSearchPage gsp = new GoogleSearchPage(driver);
gsp.setSearchString().clickSearchButton();
The Google page object class with this fluent behavior might look like this:

public abstract class BasePage {
    protected WebDriver driver;

    public BasePage(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }
}

public class GoogleSearchPage extends BasePage {
    public GoogleSearchPage(WebDriver driver) {
        super(driver);
        // Generally do not assert within pages or components.
        // Effectively throws an exception if the lambda condition is not met.
        new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(3)).until(d -> d.findElement(By.id("logo")));
    }

    public GoogleSearchPage setSearchString(String sstr) {
        driver.findElement(By.id("gbqfq")).sendKeys(sstr);
        return this;
    }

    public void clickSearchButton() {
        driver.findElement(By.id("gbqfb")).click();
    }
}


Fresh browser per test
Start each test from a clean, known state. Ideally, spin up a new virtual machine for each test. If spinning up a new virtual machine is not practical, at least start a new WebDriver for each test. Most browser drivers like GeckoDriver and ChromeDriver will start with a clean known state with a new user profile, by default.

Page object models
Note: this page has merged contents from multiple sources, including the Selenium wiki

Overview
Within your web app’s UI, there are areas where your tests interact with. A Page Object only models these as objects within the test code. This reduces the amount of duplicated code and means that if the UI changes, the fix needs only to be applied in one place.

Page Object is a Design Pattern that has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT. The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with the UI of that page. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves don’t need to change, only the code within the page object needs to change. Subsequently, all changes to support that new UI are located in one place.

Advantages
There is a clean separation between the test code and page-specific code, such as locators (or their use if you’re using a UI Map) and layout.
There is a single repository for the services or operations the page offers rather than having these services scattered throughout the tests.
In both cases, this allows any modifications required due to UI changes to all be made in one place. Helpful information on this technique can be found on numerous blogs as this ‘test design pattern’ is becoming widely used. We encourage readers who wish to know more to search the internet for blogs on this subject. Many have written on this design pattern and can provide helpful tips beyond the scope of this user guide. To get you started, we’ll illustrate page objects with a simple example.

Examples
First, consider an example, typical of test automation, that does not use a page object:

/***
 * Tests login feature
 */
public class Login {

  public void testLogin() {
    // fill login data on sign-in page
    driver.findElement(By.name("user_name")).sendKeys("userName");
    driver.findElement(By.name("password")).sendKeys("my supersecret password");
    driver.findElement(By.name("sign-in")).click();

    // verify h1 tag is "Hello userName" after login
    driver.findElement(By.tagName("h1")).isDisplayed();
    assertThat(driver.findElement(By.tagName("h1")).getText(), is("Hello userName"));
  }
}
There are two problems with this approach.

There is no separation between the test method and the AUT’s locators (IDs in this example); both are intertwined in a single method. If the AUT’s UI changes its identifiers, layout, or how a login is input and processed, the test itself must change.
The ID-locators would be spread in multiple tests, in all tests that had to use this login page.
Applying the page object techniques, this example could be rewritten like this in the following example of a page object for a Sign-in page.

import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;

/**
 * Page Object encapsulates the Sign-in page.
 */
public class SignInPage {
  protected WebDriver driver;

  // <input name="user_name" type="text" value="">
  private By usernameBy = By.name("user_name");
  // <input name="password" type="password" value="">
  private By passwordBy = By.name("password");
  // <input name="sign_in" type="submit" value="SignIn">
  private By signinBy = By.name("sign_in");

  public SignInPage(WebDriver driver){
    this.driver = driver;
     if (!driver.getTitle().equals("Sign In Page")) {
      throw new IllegalStateException("This is not Sign In Page," +
            " current page is: " + driver.getCurrentUrl());
    }
  }

  /**
    * Login as valid user
    *
    * @param userName
    * @param password
    * @return HomePage object
    */
  public HomePage loginValidUser(String userName, String password) {
    driver.findElement(usernameBy).sendKeys(userName);
    driver.findElement(passwordBy).sendKeys(password);
    driver.findElement(signinBy).click();
    return new HomePage(driver);
  }
}
and page object for a Home page could look like this.

import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;

/**
 * Page Object encapsulates the Home Page
 */
public class HomePage {
  protected WebDriver driver;

  // <h1>Hello userName</h1>
  private By messageBy = By.tagName("h1");

  public HomePage(WebDriver driver){
    this.driver = driver;
    if (!driver.getTitle().equals("Home Page of logged in user")) {
      throw new IllegalStateException("This is not Home Page of logged in user," +
            " current page is: " + driver.getCurrentUrl());
    }
  }

  /**
    * Get message (h1 tag)
    *
    * @return String message text
    */
  public String getMessageText() {
    return driver.findElement(messageBy).getText();
  }

  public HomePage manageProfile() {
    // Page encapsulation to manage profile functionality
    return new HomePage(driver);
  }
  /* More methods offering the services represented by Home Page
  of Logged User. These methods in turn might return more Page Objects
  for example click on Compose mail button could return ComposeMail class object */
}
So now, the login test would use these two page objects as follows.

/***
 * Tests login feature
 */
public class TestLogin {

  @Test
  public void testLogin() {
    SignInPage signInPage = new SignInPage(driver);
    HomePage homePage = signInPage.loginValidUser("userName", "password");
    assertThat(homePage.getMessageText(), is("Hello userName"));
  }

}
There is a lot of flexibility in how the page objects may be designed, but there are a few basic rules for getting the desired maintainability of your test code.

Assertions in Page Objects
Page objects themselves should never make verifications or assertions. This is part of your test and should always be within the test’s code, never in a page object. The page object will contain the representation of the page, and the services the page provides via methods but no code related to what is being tested should be within the page object.

There is one, single, verification which can, and should, be within the page object and that is to verify that the page, and possibly critical elements on the page, were loaded correctly. This verification should be done while instantiating the page object. In the examples above, both the SignInPage and HomePage constructors check that the expected page is available and ready for requests from the test.

Page Component Objects
A page object does not necessarily need to represent all the parts of a page itself. This was noted by Martin Fowler in the early days, while first coining the term “panel objects”.

The same principles used for page objects can be used to create “Page Component Objects”, as it was later called, that represent discrete chunks of the page and can be included in page objects. These component objects can provide references to the elements inside those discrete chunks, and methods to leverage the functionality or behavior provided by them.

For example, a Products page has multiple products.

<!-- Products Page -->
<div class="header_container">
    <span class="title">Products</span>
</div>

<div class="inventory_list">
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
    <div class="inventory_item">
    </div>
</div>
Each product is a component of the Products page.

<!-- Inventory Item -->
<div class="inventory_item">
    <div class="inventory_item_name">Backpack</div>
    <div class="pricebar">
        <div class="inventory_item_price">$29.99</div>
        <button id="add-to-cart-backpack">Add to cart</button>
    </div>
</div>
The Products page HAS-A list of products. This object relationship is called Composition. In simpler terms, something is composed of another thing.

public abstract class BasePage {
    protected WebDriver driver;

    public BasePage(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
    }
}

// Page Object
public class ProductsPage extends BasePage {
    public ProductsPage(WebDriver driver) {
        super(driver);
        // No assertions, throws an exception if the element is not loaded
        new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(3))
            .until(d -> d.findElement(By.className​("header_container")));
    }

    // Returning a list of products is a service of the page
    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        return driver.findElements(By.className​("inventory_item"))
            .stream()
            .map(e -> new Product(e)) // Map WebElement to a product component
            .toList();
    }

    // Return a specific product using a boolean-valued function (predicate)
    // This is the behavioral Strategy Pattern from GoF
    public Product getProduct(Predicate<Product> condition) {
        return getProducts()
            .stream()
            .filter(condition) // Filter by product name or price
            .findFirst()
            .orElseThrow();
    }
}
The Product component object is used inside the Products page object.

public abstract class BaseComponent {
    protected WebElement root;

    public BaseComponent(WebElement root) {
        this.root = root;
    }
}

// Page Component Object
public class Product extends BaseComponent {
    // The root element contains the entire component
    public Product(WebElement root) {
        super(root); // inventory_item
    }

    public String getName() {
        // Locating an element begins at the root of the component
        return root.findElement(By.className("inventory_item_name")).getText();
    }

    public BigDecimal getPrice() {
        return new BigDecimal(
                root.findElement(By.className("inventory_item_price"))
                    .getText()
                    .replace("$", "")
            ).setScale(2, RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY); // Sanitation and formatting
    }

    public void addToCart() {
        root.findElement(By.id("add-to-cart-backpack")).click();
    }
}
So now, the products test would use the page object and the page component object as follows.

public class ProductsTest {
    @Test
    public void testProductInventory() {
        var productsPage = new ProductsPage(driver); // page object
        var products = productsPage.getProducts();
        assertEquals(6, products.size()); // expected, actual
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testProductPrices() {
        var productsPage = new ProductsPage(driver);

        // Pass a lambda expression (predicate) to filter the list of products
        // The predicate or "strategy" is the behavior passed as parameter
        var backpack = productsPage.getProduct(p -> p.getName().equals("Backpack")); // page component object
        var bikeLight = productsPage.getProduct(p -> p.getName().equals("Bike Light"));

        assertEquals(new BigDecimal("29.99"), backpack.getPrice());
        assertEquals(new BigDecimal("9.99"), bikeLight.getPrice());
    }
}
The page and component are represented by their own objects. Both objects only have methods for the services they offer, which matches the real-world application in object-oriented programming.

You can even nest component objects inside other component objects for more complex pages. If a page in the AUT has multiple components, or common components used throughout the site (e.g. a navigation bar), then it may improve maintainability and reduce code duplication.

Other Design Patterns Used in Testing
There are other design patterns that also may be used in testing. Discussing all of these is beyond the scope of this user guide. Here, we merely want to introduce the concepts to make the reader aware of some of the things that can be done. As was mentioned earlier, many have blogged on this topic and we encourage the reader to search for blogs on these topics.

Implementation Notes
PageObjects can be thought of as facing in two directions simultaneously. Facing toward the developer of a test, they represent the services offered by a particular page. Facing away from the developer, they should be the only thing that has a deep knowledge of the structure of the HTML of a page (or part of a page) It’s simplest to think of the methods on a Page Object as offering the “services” that a page offers rather than exposing the details and mechanics of the page. As an example, think of the inbox of any web-based email system. Amongst the services it offers are the ability to compose a new email, choose to read a single email, and list the subject lines of the emails in the inbox. How these are implemented shouldn’t matter to the test.

Because we’re encouraging the developer of a test to try and think about the services they’re interacting with rather than the implementation, PageObjects should seldom expose the underlying WebDriver instance. To facilitate this, methods on the PageObject should return other PageObjects. This means we can effectively model the user’s journey through our application. It also means that should the way that pages relate to one another change (like when the login page asks the user to change their password the first time they log into a service when it previously didn’t do that), simply changing the appropriate method’s signature will cause the tests to fail to compile. Put another way; we can tell which tests would fail without needing to run them when we change the relationship between pages and reflect this in the PageObjects.

One consequence of this approach is that it may be necessary to model (for example) both a successful and unsuccessful login; or a click could have a different result depending on the app’s state. When this happens, it is common to have multiple methods on the PageObject:

public class LoginPage {
    public HomePage loginAs(String username, String password) {
        // ... clever magic happens here
    }
    
    public LoginPage loginAsExpectingError(String username, String password) {
        //  ... failed login here, maybe because one or both of the username and password are wrong
    }
    
    public String getErrorMessage() {
        // So we can verify that the correct error is shown
    }
}
The code presented above shows an important point: the tests, not the PageObjects, should be responsible for making assertions about the state of a page. For example:

public void testMessagesAreReadOrUnread() {
    Inbox inbox = new Inbox(driver);
    inbox.assertMessageWithSubjectIsUnread("I like cheese");
    inbox.assertMessageWithSubjectIsNotUnread("I'm not fond of tofu");
}
could be re-written as:

public void testMessagesAreReadOrUnread() {
    Inbox inbox = new Inbox(driver);
    assertTrue(inbox.isMessageWithSubjectIsUnread("I like cheese"));
    assertFalse(inbox.isMessageWithSubjectIsUnread("I'm not fond of tofu"));
}
Of course, as with every guideline, there are exceptions, and one that is commonly seen with PageObjects is to check that the WebDriver is on the correct page when we instantiate the PageObject. This is done in the example below.

Finally, a PageObject need not represent an entire page. It may represent a section that appears frequently within a site or page, such as site navigation. The essential principle is that there is only one place in your test suite with knowledge of the structure of the HTML of a particular (part of a) page.

Summary
The public methods represent the services that the page offers
Try not to expose the internals of the page
Generally don’t make assertions
Methods return other PageObjects
Need not represent an entire page
Different results for the same action are modelled as different methods
Example
public class LoginPage {
    private final WebDriver driver;

    public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;

        // Check that we're on the right page.
        if (!"Login".equals(driver.getTitle())) {
            // Alternatively, we could navigate to the login page, perhaps logging out first
            throw new IllegalStateException("This is not the login page");
        }
    }

    // The login page contains several HTML elements that will be represented as WebElements.
    // The locators for these elements should only be defined once.
        By usernameLocator = By.id("username");
        By passwordLocator = By.id("passwd");
        By loginButtonLocator = By.id("login");

    // The login page allows the user to type their username into the username field
    public LoginPage typeUsername(String username) {
        // This is the only place that "knows" how to enter a username
        driver.findElement(usernameLocator).sendKeys(username);

        // Return the current page object as this action doesn't navigate to a page represented by another PageObject
        return this;	
    }

    // The login page allows the user to type their password into the password field
    public LoginPage typePassword(String password) {
        // This is the only place that "knows" how to enter a password
        driver.findElement(passwordLocator).sendKeys(password);

        // Return the current page object as this action doesn't navigate to a page represented by another PageObject
        return this;	
    }

    // The login page allows the user to submit the login form
    public HomePage submitLogin() {
        // This is the only place that submits the login form and expects the destination to be the home page.
        // A seperate method should be created for the instance of clicking login whilst expecting a login failure. 
        driver.findElement(loginButtonLocator).submit();

        // Return a new page object representing the destination. Should the login page ever
        // go somewhere else (for example, a legal disclaimer) then changing the method signature
        // for this method will mean that all tests that rely on this behaviour won't compile.
        return new HomePage(driver);	
    }

    // The login page allows the user to submit the login form knowing that an invalid username and / or password were entered
    public LoginPage submitLoginExpectingFailure() {
        // This is the only place that submits the login form and expects the destination to be the login page due to login failure.
        driver.findElement(loginButtonLocator).submit();

        // Return a new page object representing the destination. Should the user ever be navigated to the home page after submiting a login with credentials 
        // expected to fail login, the script will fail when it attempts to instantiate the LoginPage PageObject.
        return new LoginPage(driver);	
    }

    // Conceptually, the login page offers the user the service of being able to "log into"
    // the application using a user name and password. 
    public HomePage loginAs(String username, String password) {
        // The PageObject methods that enter username, password & submit login have already defined and should not be repeated here.
        typeUsername(username);
        typePassword(password);
        return submitLogin();
    }
}

Domain specific language
A domain specific language (DSL) is a system which provides the user with an expressive means of solving a problem. It allows a user to interact with the system on their terms – not just programmer-speak.

Your users, in general, do not care how your site looks. They do not care about the decoration, animations, or graphics. They want to use your system to push their new employees through the process with minimal difficulty; they want to book travel to Alaska; they want to configure and buy unicorns at a discount. Your job as tester is to come as close as you can to “capturing” this mind-set. With that in mind, we set about “modeling” the application you are working on, such that the test scripts (the user’s only pre-release proxy) “speak” for, and represent the user.

The goal is to use ubiquitous language. Rather than referring to “load data into this table” or “click on the third column” it should be possible to use language such as “create a new account” or “order displayed results by name”

With Selenium, DSL is usually represented by methods, written to make the API simple and readable – they enable a report between the developers and the stakeholders (users, product owners, business intelligence specialists, etc.).

Benefits
Readable: Business stakeholders can understand it.
Writable: Easy to write, avoids unnecessary duplication.
Extensible: Functionality can (reasonably) be added without breaking contracts and existing functionality.
Maintainable: By leaving the implementation details out of test cases, you are well-insulated against changes to the AUT*.
Further Reading
(previously located: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Domain-Driven-Design)

There is a good book on Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321125215/domainlanguag-20

And to whet your appetite there’s a useful smaller book available online for download at http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly

Java
Here is an example of a reasonable DSL method in Java. For brevity’s sake, it assumes the driver object is pre-defined and available to the method.

/**
 * Takes a username and password, fills out the fields, and clicks "login".
 * @return An instance of the AccountPage
 */
public AccountPage loginAsUser(String username, String password) {
  WebElement loginField = driver.findElement(By.id("loginField"));
  loginField.clear();
  loginField.sendKeys(username);

  // Fill out the password field. The locator we're using is "By.id", and we should
  // have it defined elsewhere in the class.
  WebElement passwordField = driver.findElement(By.id("password"));
  passwordField.clear();
  passwordField.sendKeys(password);

  // Click the login button, which happens to have the id "submit".
  driver.findElement(By.id("submit")).click();

  // Create and return a new instance of the AccountPage (via the built-in Selenium
  // PageFactory).
  return PageFactory.newInstance(AccountPage.class);
}
This method completely abstracts the concepts of input fields, buttons, clicking, and even pages from your test code. Using this approach, all a tester has to do is call this method. This gives you a maintenance advantage: if the login fields ever changed, you would only ever have to change this method - not your tests.

public void loginTest() {
    loginAsUser("cbrown", "cl0wn3");

    // Now that we're logged in, do some other stuff--since we used a DSL to support
    // our testers, it's as easy as choosing from available methods.
    do.something();
    do.somethingElse();
    Assert.assertTrue("Something should have been done!", something.wasDone());

    // Note that we still haven't referred to a button or web control anywhere in this
    // script...
}
It bears repeating: one of your primary goals should be writing an API that allows your tests to address the problem at hand, and NOT the problem of the UI. The UI is a secondary concern for your users – they do not care about the UI, they just want to get their job done. Your test scripts should read like a laundry list of things the user wants to DO, and the things they want to KNOW. The tests should not concern themselves with HOW the UI requires you to go about it.

*AUT: Application under test

Generating application state
Selenium should not be used to prepare a test case. All repetitive actions and preparations for a test case, should be done through other methods. For example, most web UIs have authentication (e.g. a login form). Eliminating logging in via web browser before every test will improve both the speed and stability of the test. A method should be created to gain access to the AUT* (e.g. using an API to login and set a cookie). Also, creating methods to pre-load data for testing should not be done using Selenium. As mentioned previously, existing APIs should be leveraged to create data for the AUT*.

*AUT: Application under test

Captchas
CAPTCHA, short for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, is explicitly designed to prevent automation, so do not try! There are two primary strategies to get around CAPTCHA checks:

Disable CAPTCHAs in your test environment
Add a hook to allow tests to bypass the CAPTCHA

File downloads
Whilst it is possible to start a download by clicking a link with a browser under Selenium’s control, the API does not expose download progress, making it less than ideal for testing downloaded files. This is because downloading files is not considered an important aspect of emulating user interaction with the web platform. Instead, find the link using Selenium (and any required cookies) and pass it to a HTTP request library like libcurl.

The HtmlUnit driver can download attachments by accessing them as input streams by implementing the AttachmentHandler interface. The AttachmentHandler can then be added to the HtmlUnit WebClient.

HTTP response codes
For some browser configurations in Selenium RC, Selenium acted as a proxy between the browser and the site being automated. This meant that all browser traffic passed through Selenium could be captured or manipulated. The captureNetworkTraffic() method purported to capture all of the network traffic between the browser and the site being automated, including HTTP response codes.

Selenium WebDriver is a completely different approach to browser automation, preferring to act more like a user. This is represented in the way you write tests with WebDriver. In automated functional testing, checking the status code is not a particularly important detail of a test’s failure; the steps that preceded it are more important.

The browser will always represent the HTTP status code, imagine for example a 404 or a 500 error page. A simple way to “fail fast” when you encounter one of these error pages is to check the page title or content of a reliable point (e.g. the <h1> tag) after every page load. If you are using the page object model, you can include this check in your class constructor or similar point where the page load is expected. Occasionally, the HTTP code may even be represented in the browser’s error page and you could use WebDriver to read this and improve your debugging output.

Checking the webpage itself is in line with WebDriver’s ideal practice of representing and asserting upon the user’s view of the website.

If you insist, an advanced solution to capturing HTTP status codes is to replicate the behaviour of Selenium RC by using a proxy. WebDriver API provides the ability to set a proxy for the browser, and there are a number of proxies that will programmatically allow you to manipulate the contents of requests sent to and received from the web server. Using a proxy lets you decide how you want to respond to redirection response codes. Additionally, not every browser makes the response codes available to WebDriver, so opting to use a proxy allows you to have a solution that works for every browser.

Gmail, email and Facebook logins
For multiple reasons, logging into sites like Gmail and Facebook using WebDriver is not recommended. Aside from being against the usage terms for these sites (where you risk having the account shut down), it is slow and unreliable.

The ideal practice is to use the APIs that email providers offer, or in the case of Facebook the developer tools service which exposes an API for creating test accounts, friends and so forth. Although using an API might seem like a bit of extra hard work, you will be paid back in speed, reliability, and stability. The API is also unlikely to change, whereas webpages and HTML locators change often and require you to update your test framework.

Logging in to third party sites using WebDriver at any point of your test increases the risk of your test failing because it makes your test longer. A general rule of thumb is that longer tests are more fragile and unreliable.

WebDriver implementations that are W3C conformant also annotate the navigator object with a WebDriver property so that Denial of Service attacks can be mitigated.

Test dependency
A common idea and misconception about automated testing is regarding a specific test order. Your tests should be able to run in any order, and not rely on other tests to complete in order to be successful.

Performance testing
Performance testing using Selenium and WebDriver is generally not advised. Not because it is incapable, but because it is not optimised for the job and you are unlikely to get good results.

It may seem ideal to performance test in the context of the user but a suite of WebDriver tests are subjected to many points of external and internal fragility which are beyond your control; for example browser startup speed, speed of HTTP servers, response of third party servers that host JavaScript or CSS, and the instrumentation penalty of the WebDriver implementation itself. Variation at these points will cause variation in your results. It is difficult to separate the difference between the performance of your website and the performance of external resources, and it is also hard to tell what the performance penalty is for using WebDriver in the browser, especially if you are injecting scripts.

The other potential attraction is “saving time” — carrying out functional and performance tests at the same time. However, functional and performance tests have opposing objectives. To test functionality, a tester may need to be patient and wait for loading, but this will cloud the performance testing results and vice versa.

To improve the performance of your website, you will need to be able to analyse overall performance independent of environment differences, identify poor code practices, breakdown of performance of individual resources (i.e. CSS or JavaScript), in order to know what to improve. There are performance testing tools available that can do this job already, that provide reporting and analysis, and can even make improvement suggestions.

Link spidering
Using WebDriver to spider through links is not a recommended practice. Not because it cannot be done, but because WebDriver is definitely not the most ideal tool for this. WebDriver needs time to start up, and can take several seconds, up to a minute depending on how your test is written, just to get to the page and traverse through the DOM.

Instead of using WebDriver for this, you could save a ton of time by executing a curl command, or using a library such as BeautifulSoup since these methods do not rely on creating a browser and navigating to a page. You are saving tonnes of time by not using WebDriver for this task.

Two Factor Authentication
Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is an authorization mechanism where a One Time Password (OTP) is generated using “Authenticator” mobile apps such as “Google Authenticator”, “Microsoft Authenticator” etc., or by SMS, e-mail to authenticate. Automating this seamlessly and consistently is a big challenge in Selenium. There are some ways to automate this process. But that will be another layer on top of our Selenium tests and not as secure. So, you should avoid automating 2FA.

There are few options to get around 2FA checks:

If you want the functionality to still be tested, one option is to ask your team to create a “special token” that will work in test environment. That won’t require usage of a mobile device, and will ensure the test journey is covered.
Disable 2FA for certain Users in the test environment, so that you can use those user credentials in the automation.
Disable 2FA in your test environment.
Disable 2FA if you login from certain IPs. That way we can configure our test machine IPs to avoid this.
